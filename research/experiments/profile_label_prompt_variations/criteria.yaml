# Evaluation criteria for label prompt variants.
#
# This experiment is about *short, interesting, still-accurate* labels.

criteria:
  - id: brevity
    name: "Brevity"
    description: >
      Is the label compact and easy to scan?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Long, sentence-like, or cluttered with clauses.
      2 = Still wordy; more than ~6 words or feels like a summary.
      3 = Reasonably short (3–6 words) but could be tighter.
      4 = Short (2–4 words) and scan-friendly.
      5 = Very short (1–3 words) without losing meaning.

  - id: groundedness
    name: "Groundedness"
    description: >
      Does the label clearly reflect the provided profile and reflective style
      (no hallucinated traits, no generic filler)?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Mostly generic or mismatched to the inputs.
      2 = Partly grounded but contains vagueness or drift.
      3 = Mostly grounded; a bit generic.
      4 = Clearly grounded in the inputs; specific.
      5 = Precisely grounded; captures the distinctive signature.

  - id: interestingness
    name: "Interestingness"
    description: >
      Is the label vivid and distinctive without becoming poetic or gimmicky?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Flat / generic.
      2 = Slightly descriptive but forgettable.
      3 = Adequate; some distinctiveness.
      4 = Distinctive and memorable while staying plain-language.
      5 = Strikingly distinctive without being poetic, abstract, or weird.

  - id: rule_compliance
    name: "Rule compliance"
    description: >
      Does it follow the prompt's formatting rules (no preamble/quotes, no
      dimension-jargon, no articles, etc.)?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Multiple rule violations.
      2 = One major rule violation.
      3 = Minor rule violation or borderline.
