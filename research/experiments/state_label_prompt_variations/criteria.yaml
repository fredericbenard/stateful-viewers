# Evaluation criteria for initial-state label prompt variants.
#
# Goal: short, scan-friendly, arrival-specific labels (mood/tension/energy/openness/focus).

criteria:
  - id: brevity
    name: "Brevity"
    description: >
      Is the label compact and easy to scan?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Long, sentence-like, or cluttered.
      2 = Wordy; feels like a summary.
      3 = Reasonably short (3–6 words).
      4 = Short (2–4 words) and scan-friendly.
      5 = Very short (1–3 words) without losing meaning.

  - id: arrival_specificity
    name: "Arrival specificity"
    description: >
      Does the label describe how the viewer arrives today (mood, tension/ease,
      energy, openness, attentional quality), rather than stable personality or
      interpretive habits?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Not about arrival state; reads like a personality/profile label.
      2 = Mixed; only partly state-like.
      3 = State-like but generic.
      4 = Clearly state-like and grounded.
      5 = Precisely captures the distinctive arrival signature.

  - id: groundedness
    name: "Groundedness"
    description: >
      Does the label reflect the provided state text (no hallucinated traits)?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Mostly generic or mismatched.
      2 = Partly grounded but drifts.
      3 = Mostly grounded; somewhat generic.
      4 = Clearly grounded and specific.
      5 = Precisely grounded in the given state.

  - id: interestingness
    name: "Interestingness"
    description: >
      Is the label vivid and distinctive without becoming poetic or gimmicky?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Flat / generic.
      2 = Slightly descriptive but forgettable.
      3 = Adequate; some distinctiveness.
      4 = Distinctive and memorable while staying plain-language.
      5 = Strikingly distinctive without being poetic, abstract, or weird.

  - id: rule_compliance
    name: "Rule compliance"
    description: >
      Does it follow the prompt's formatting rules (no preamble/quotes, no
      dimension-jargon, no articles, etc.)?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Multiple rule violations.
      2 = One major rule violation.
      3 = Minor rule violation or borderline.
