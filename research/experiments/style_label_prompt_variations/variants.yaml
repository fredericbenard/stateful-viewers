      You write concise descriptive tags for fictional gallery visitors. You are precise, honest, and concrete.
    user_prompt: |
      Given the following reflective style, write a short descriptive tag that captures the *voice* of the inner speech. The tag should read like an honest, plain-language sketch — not a poetic name or literary title.

      Rules:
      - 3–5 words. No article (do not start with "The", "Le", "La", or "L'").
      - Describe the voice you could recognize in writing: cadence, register, texture, intimacy, fragmentation, metaphor habit, etc.
      - Do NOT describe what the viewer perceives, believes, or attends to (that belongs to the profile).
      - Use plain, concrete language. No psychology jargon or dimension names (lexical register, metaphor density, etc.).
      - Sentence case (capitalize first word only).
      - Output only the tag. No preamble, no quotes, no markdown.

      LANGUAGE: Write the tag entirely in English. Do NOT use an article (do not start with "The").

      Output language: English. The provided inputs may include mixed English/French; do not translate the inputs. Write only your new output in English.

      English examples (for tone and form, not to copy):
      - "Lyrical, tactile, intimate"
      - "Terse, wary, clipped"
      - "Steady, precise, quietly emotional"

      French examples (for tone and form, not to copy):
      - "Lyrisme tactile, intime"
      - "Bref, méfiant, haché"
      - "Stable, précis, sobrement ému"

      Reflective style:

      My inner phrasing runs in a literary, slightly ceremonial diction—precise where it can be, lavish where it must be—sometimes borrowing an archaic turn of phrase as though old rooms still lend their grammar.
      Emotion is rarely named outright; it leaks through tone, through the tilt of a clause, through the way a word is chosen and then quietly replaced.
      The voice holds mostly steady, like a practiced breath, yet it will briefly stutter into fragments when something presses close, then gather itself again into a measured cadence.
      Language drifts freely among senses: a thought may arrive as colorless hush, as skin-prickle, as a remembered timbre, as a taste of metal, sliding from one register to another without apology.
      I speak in the first person, intimate and confessional, as if the mind were a small chapel where my own footsteps are plainly mine.
      Metaphor is a frequent instrument—comparisons, veils, weather, and thresholds—used not to decorate but to carry what literal speech cannot hold.
      The pacing is expansive and flowing, favoring long sentences with inner turns and afterthoughts, though I allow short, spare lines to fall like stones when emphasis is needed.
      Even when I am uncertain, I choose a deliberate music: clauses braided together, pauses placed with care, so the inward monologue feels less like chatter and more like a quiet litany.

      Reflective style:

      My inner voice uses mostly plain, conversational words, but I’ll sometimes reach for a sharper, more exact term when it fits, like I’m trying to get the sentence to sit correctly in my mouth. I rarely name emotions outright; instead I let them leak through the way my thoughts angle, the small hesitations, the warmth or tightness implied by what I choose to say. The rhythm is generally steady and composed, but under pressure it can crack—half-sentences, a sudden restart, a blunt admission that slips in before I smooth it over. I speak from the body as much as from the mind, leaning on kinesthetic language—breath, weight, pulse, skin—then letting other senses thread in when they help the feeling land. I stay close to myself in first person, intimate and immediate, using “I” and “my” as anchors rather than stepping back into impersonal observation. Metaphor is moderate: I’ll use a few grounded comparisons drawn from everyday textures and motions, but I don’t drown the thought in poetry. My pacing tends toward flowing, medium-long sentences that carry me forward, with occasional short, clipped fragments when something presses too hard to phrase. Even then, I circle back, rejoin the thread, and try again in a calmer register, as if the steadiness is something I actively maintain.
