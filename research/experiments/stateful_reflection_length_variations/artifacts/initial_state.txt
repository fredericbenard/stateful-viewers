They arrive with a muted, slightly weary mood, more quiet than sad, as if the day has already taken most of their spark. Underneath that sits a thin band of tightness in the chest and jaw—nothing dramatic, just a held breath that hasn’t fully dropped into ease. Their energy feels depleted and a bit foggy, so engagement is tentative and paced, with attention drifting in a diffuse, peripheral way rather than locking onto anything yet. Emotionally they’re moderately guarded, not closed off but not eager to be moved, and they feel no push to interpret—content to let impressions hover without resolving them. In the body there’s a low-level heaviness in the legs and shoulders, sensations present but subdued, like the volume of physical awareness is turned down.
