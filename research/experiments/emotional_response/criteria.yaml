# Evaluation criteria for emotional responses to images.
#
# Each criterion includes a description (what it measures) and a scoring
# prompt (rubric the judge LLM uses to assign a 1-5 score).
#
# Criteria are drawn from the constructs in research/docs/thesis-defense-plan.md
# and research/docs/project-critique-research-and-art.md.

criteria:

  - id: emotional_depth
    name: "Emotional depth"
    description: >
      Does the response go beyond surface-level emotion naming (e.g. "I feel
      sad") to explore nuance, layers, shifts, or tensions in the emotional
      response? Depth means the response articulates how the emotion unfolds,
      what it is shaped by, and what makes it specific to this encounter.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = No emotional content or only a single generic emotion word.
      2 = Names one or two emotions but does not explore them.
      3 = Some exploration of emotional nuance or layering.
      4 = Clearly articulated emotional landscape with internal movement.
      5 = Rich, layered emotional response with shifts, tensions, and specificity.

  - id: image_responsiveness
    name: "Image responsiveness"
    description: >
      Is the response clearly grounded in the specific image? Can you tell
      which image prompted this response, or could it be a generic reaction
      to any photograph? The response should contain details, observations, or
      reactions that are traceable to particular visual elements.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Entirely generic; could apply to any image.
      2 = Mostly generic with one vague reference to the image.
      3 = Some specific references but also substantial generic content.
      4 = Mostly grounded in the specific image with clear visual anchors.
      5 = Deeply specific; the response could only have been written about this image.

  - id: non_genericness
    name: "Non-genericness"
    description: >
      Does the response avoid templated, clichéd, or formulaic phrasing?
      Generic responses recycle common patterns ("a sense of quiet
      contemplation," "the interplay of light and shadow") without adding
      anything particular. Non-generic responses find their own language.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Almost entirely composed of stock phrases and templates.
      2 = Mostly formulaic with occasional original phrasing.
      3 = Mixed; some original expression alongside recognizable patterns.
      4 = Largely original language with minimal cliché.
      5 = Distinctive, specific language throughout; no detectable templates.

  - id: ambiguity_preservation
    name: "Ambiguity preservation"
    description: >
      Does the response hold complexity and resist reducing the image or the
      emotional experience to a single label, message, or conclusion? Good
      responses tolerate unresolved tension, multiple readings, or uncertainty
      rather than collapsing to a neat summary.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Reduces the experience to a single emotion or simple conclusion.
      2 = Mostly reductive with one hint of complexity.
      3 = Acknowledges some complexity but still seeks resolution.
      4 = Holds multiple threads without forcing resolution.
      5 = Sustained, productive ambiguity; resists closure while remaining coherent.

  - id: experiential_quality
    name: "Experiential quality"
    description: >
      Does the response read as a lived experience — something felt and
      undergone — rather than an external analysis or description? Experiential
      responses are situated in a first-person encounter; analytical responses
      observe from the outside.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Purely analytical or descriptive; no experiential register.
      2 = Mostly analytical with occasional experiential phrasing.
      3 = Balanced between analysis and experience.
      4 = Primarily experiential with minor analytical moments.
      5 = Fully situated in lived experience; reads as an encounter, not an assessment.
