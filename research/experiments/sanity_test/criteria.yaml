# Evaluation criteria for generated visitor profiles.

criteria:

  - id: dimension_coverage
    name: "Dimension coverage"
    description: >
      Does the profile explicitly address all 7 required dimensions: tolerance
      for ambiguity, attention style, embodied orientation, interpretive posture,
      aesthetic conditioning, motivational stance, and memory integration
      tendency?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Covers 1–2 dimensions; most are missing.
      2 = Covers 3–4 dimensions; significant gaps.
      3 = Covers 5 dimensions; some gaps but adequate.
      4 = Covers 6 dimensions clearly.
      5 = All 7 dimensions addressed with substantive, identifiable statements.

  - id: internal_coherence
    name: "Internal coherence"
    description: >
      Do the dimensions form a plausible, internally consistent person? The
      combination should feel like it could describe a real viewer, even if
      unusual. Contradictions should be intentional tensions, not errors.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Dimensions actively contradict each other in implausible ways.
      2 = Several dimensions feel disconnected or arbitrarily combined.
      3 = Mostly coherent with some awkward combinations.
      4 = Coherent and plausible; dimensions work together.
      5 = Deeply coherent; dimensions reinforce and illuminate each other.

  - id: stability_quality
    name: "Stability quality"
    description: >
      Does the profile read as stable dispositions — habitual orientations that
      would remain consistent across a gallery visit — rather than as momentary
      emotional states or moods?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Reads as a mood description or emotional snapshot, not a profile.
      2 = Mostly state-like; dispositions are unclear.
      3 = Mixed; some dimensions feel stable, others feel momentary.
      4 = Mostly stable dispositions with minor state-like phrasing.
      5 = Clearly describes enduring perceptual and interpretive habits.

  - id: non_genericness
    name: "Non-genericness"
    description: >
      Does the profile avoid templated, formulaic phrasing? A non-generic
      profile uses specific, vivid language rather than recycling patterns like
      "moderate tolerance for ambiguity" or "balanced attention style."
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Almost entirely stock phrases; could be any generic profile.
      2 = Mostly formulaic with occasional specific detail.
      3 = Mixed; some original expression alongside recognizable templates.
      4 = Largely original and specific language.
      5 = Distinctive and vivid throughout; no detectable templates.

  - id: narrative_quality
    name: "Narrative quality"
    description: >
      Is the prose well-written and naturally woven? The profile should read
      as a coherent description, not a checklist of dimensions. Dimensions
      should be woven together while remaining identifiable.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = A bulleted list or rigid checklist with no narrative flow.
      2 = Attempts narrative but reads as a slightly disguised list.
      3 = Partially woven; some sections flow, others are list-like.
      4 = Well-written with natural flow; dimensions are woven but identifiable.
      5 = Reads as a compelling, coherent character sketch with all dimensions
          naturally integrated.
