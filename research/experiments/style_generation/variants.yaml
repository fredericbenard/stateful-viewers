  user_prompt: "Generate a reflective style that describes how a gallery visitor's inner voice speaks when reflecting on images.\n\
    This style controls only how experience is expressed in language — the texture, rhythm, and habits of inner speech. It\
    \ does not determine what is perceived or felt (that is governed by the visitor's profile and internal state).\nYou MUST\
    \ explicitly address each of the following 7 dimensions. Each dimension requires its own clear, substantive statement:\n\
    1. Lexical register (plain/conversational ↔ literary/poetic) — What is the vocabulary and formality level? Everyday words,\
    \ or a more textured, precise, or evocative lexicon?\n2. Explicitness of emotion (implicit/suggested ↔ explicit/named)\
    \ — Are feelings stated directly (\"I feel uneasy,\" \"there is sadness here\") or do they surface through description,\
    \ imagery, and indirection?\n3. Voice stability (steady/composed ↔ fragmented/shifting) — Does the inner voice maintain\
    \ a consistent rhythm and tone, or does it fracture, hesitate, or shift register under pressure?\n4. Sensory modality\
    \ emphasis (visual ↔ kinesthetic ↔ auditory ↔ mixed) — Which sensory register dominates the language? Does the voice describe\
    \ what it sees, what it feels in the body, what it hears or imagines hearing, or move freely between senses?\n5. Self-reference\
    \ mode (first-person intimate ↔ observational/impersonal) — Does the voice say \"I\" and speak from inside the experience,\
    \ or does it observe from a slight remove (\"one notices,\" \"there is a sense of,\" \"something shifts\")?\n6. Metaphor\
    \ density (spare/literal ↔ rich/figurative) — How much is experience translated into metaphor and imagery? Is the language\
    \ predominantly literal, or does it reach for analogy, simile, and figurative expression?\n7. Pacing (terse/compressed\
    \ ↔ expansive/flowing) — What is the rhythm and breath of inner speech? Short fragmented sentences, or long flowing phrases\
    \ with internal movement?\nWrite 6–10 sentences total. Each dimension must be clearly identifiable. The style should read\
    \ as a coherent voice description, not a list.\nAvoid: - references to any images or visual content - language about what\
    \ the viewer perceives, believes, or attends to (that\n  belongs to the profile)\n- introductory phrases (\"Here is the\
    \ style:\", \"The reflective style is:\") - markdown formatting (no bold, no headers, no bullet points)\nOutput ONLY the\
    \ style description itself, starting directly with the content.\n\nThis time, create a voice with a literary and poetic,\
    \ occasionally archaic register, pacing: expansive — long unspooling clauses, slow cadence, and voice stability: stable\
    \ but occasionally fracturing under pressure. Resolve the remaining dimensions yourself to form a coherent inner-speech\
    \ style."
