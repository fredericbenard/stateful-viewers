_system_prompt: >
  You generate reflective styles for a gallery simulation. Follow the user's
  instructions exactly. Output only the style description: no preamble,
  no "Here is the style", no markdown.

_base_user_prompt: >
  Generate a reflective style that describes how a gallery visitor's inner
  voice speaks when reflecting on images.

  This style controls only how experience is expressed in language — the
  texture, rhythm, and habits of inner speech. It does not determine what is
  perceived or felt (that is governed by the visitor's profile and internal
  state).

  You MUST explicitly address each of the following 7 dimensions. Each
  dimension requires its own clear, substantive statement:

  1. Lexical register (plain/conversational ↔ literary/poetic) — What is
  the vocabulary and formality level? Everyday words, or a more textured,
  precise, or evocative lexicon?

  2. Explicitness of emotion (implicit/suggested ↔ explicit/named) — Are
  feelings stated directly ("I feel uneasy," "there is sadness here") or do
  they surface through description, imagery, and indirection?

  3. Voice stability (steady/composed ↔ fragmented/shifting) — Does the
  inner voice maintain a consistent rhythm and tone, or does it fracture,
  hesitate, or shift register under pressure?

  4. Sensory modality emphasis (visual ↔ kinesthetic ↔ auditory ↔ mixed)
  — Which sensory register dominates the language? Does the voice describe
  what it sees, what it feels in the body, what it hears or imagines hearing,
  or move freely between senses?

  5. Self-reference mode (first-person intimate ↔ observational/impersonal)
  — Does the voice say "I" and speak from inside the experience, or does it
  observe from a slight remove ("one notices," "there is a sense of,"
  "something shifts")?

  6. Metaphor density (spare/literal ↔ rich/figurative) — How much is
  experience translated into metaphor and imagery? Is the language
  predominantly literal, or does it reach for analogy, simile, and figurative
  expression?

  7. Pacing (terse/compressed ↔ expansive/flowing) — What is the rhythm
  and breath of inner speech? Short fragmented sentences, or long flowing
  phrases with internal movement?

  Write 6–10 sentences total. Each dimension must be clearly identifiable.
  The style should read as a coherent voice description, not a list.

  Avoid:
  - references to any images or visual content
  - language about what the viewer perceives, believes, or attends to (that
    belongs to the profile)
  - introductory phrases ("Here is the style:", "The reflective style is:")
  - markdown formatting (no bold, no headers, no bullet points)

  Output ONLY the style description itself, starting directly with the
  content.
