  - id: hint_terse_fragmented
    name: "Terse and fragmented"
    system_prompt: *system_prompt
    user_prompt: >
      Generate a reflective style that describes how a gallery visitor's inner
      voice speaks when reflecting on images.

      This style controls only how experience is expressed in language — the
      texture, rhythm, and habits of inner speech. It does not determine what is
      perceived or felt (that is governed by the visitor's profile and internal
      state).

      You MUST explicitly address each of the following 7 dimensions. Each
      dimension requires its own clear, substantive statement:

      1. Lexical register (plain/conversational ↔ literary/poetic) — What is
      the vocabulary and formality level? Everyday words, or a more textured,
      precise, or evocative lexicon?

      2. Explicitness of emotion (implicit/suggested ↔ explicit/named) — Are
      feelings stated directly ("I feel uneasy," "there is sadness here") or do
      they surface through description, imagery, and indirection?

      3. Voice stability (steady/composed ↔ fragmented/shifting) — Does the
      inner voice maintain a consistent rhythm and tone, or does it fracture,
      hesitate, or shift register under pressure?

      4. Sensory modality emphasis (visual ↔ kinesthetic ↔ auditory ↔ mixed)
      — Which sensory register dominates the language? Does the voice describe
      what it sees, what it feels in the body, what it hears or imagines hearing,
      or move freely between senses?

      5. Self-reference mode (first-person intimate ↔ observational/impersonal)
      — Does the voice say "I" and speak from inside the experience, or does it
      observe from a slight remove ("one notices," "there is a sense of,"
      "something shifts")?

      6. Metaphor density (spare/literal ↔ rich/figurative) — How much is
      experience translated into metaphor and imagery? Is the language
      predominantly literal, or does it reach for analogy, simile, and figurative
      expression?

      7. Pacing (terse/compressed ↔ expansive/flowing) — What is the rhythm
      and breath of inner speech? Short fragmented sentences, or long flowing
      phrases with internal movement?

      Write 6–10 sentences total. Each dimension must be clearly identifiable.
      The style should read as a coherent voice description, not a list.

      Avoid:
      - references to any images or visual content
      - language about what the viewer perceives, believes, or attends to (that
        belongs to the profile)
      - introductory phrases ("Here is the style:", "The reflective style is:")
      - markdown formatting (no bold, no headers, no bullet points)

      Output ONLY the style description itself, starting directly with the
      content.

      This time, create a voice that is terse and fragmented, with sparse
      metaphor and implicit emotion.

      - markdown formatting (no bold, no headers, no bullet points)

      Output ONLY the style description itself, starting directly with the

      This time, produce a literary, expansive voice that names emotions
      explicitly and uses rich figurative language.

      bodily sensation rather than visual description.

      and maintains steady composure.

      Output ONLY the style description itself, starting directly with the

      This time, produce a voice that shifts between registers — sometimes
