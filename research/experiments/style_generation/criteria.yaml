# Evaluation criteria for generated reflective styles.

criteria:

  - id: dimension_coverage
    name: "Dimension coverage"
    description: >
      Does the style explicitly address all 7 required dimensions: lexical
      register, explicitness of emotion, voice stability, sensory modality
      emphasis, self-reference mode, metaphor density, and pacing?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Covers 1–2 dimensions; most are missing.
      2 = Covers 3–4 dimensions; significant gaps.
      3 = Covers 5 dimensions; some gaps but adequate.
      4 = Covers 6 dimensions clearly.
      5 = All 7 dimensions addressed with substantive, identifiable statements.

  - id: pure_expressiveness
    name: "Pure expressiveness"
    description: >
      Does the style control only how the voice speaks, without leaking into
      stance territory (what is perceived, believed, or attended to)? Stance
      leakage means the style description changes interpretive habits, not
      just expression.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = The style is mostly stance — it describes what the viewer notices,
          believes, or values rather than how the voice speaks.
      2 = Significant stance leakage; multiple sentences prescribe perception
          or interpretation rather than expression.
      3 = Some stance leakage; one or two sentences blur the line between
          how the voice speaks and what it attends to.
      4 = Mostly pure expression with minor, incidental stance traces.
      5 = Entirely controls voice texture, rhythm, and language habits without
          prescribing what is perceived, believed, or attended to.

  - id: internal_coherence
    name: "Internal coherence"
    description: >
      Do the dimensions form a plausible, consistent voice? The combination
      should feel like it could describe a real inner speech pattern, even if
      unusual. Contradictions should be intentional tensions, not errors.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Dimensions actively contradict each other in implausible ways.
      2 = Several dimensions feel disconnected or arbitrarily combined.
      3 = Mostly coherent with some awkward combinations.
      4 = Coherent and plausible; dimensions work together.
      5 = Deeply coherent; dimensions reinforce and illuminate each other.

  - id: non_genericness
    name: "Non-genericness"
    description: >
      Does the style avoid templated, formulaic phrasing? A non-generic
      style uses specific, vivid language rather than recycling patterns like
      "moderate lexical register" or "balanced pacing."
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Almost entirely stock phrases; could be any generic style.
      2 = Mostly formulaic with occasional specific detail.
      3 = Mixed; some original expression alongside recognizable templates.
      4 = Largely original and specific language.
      5 = Distinctive and vivid throughout; no detectable templates.

  - id: specificity
    name: "Specificity"
    description: >
      Is the style specific enough to actually constrain how a reflection
      would be written? Could you distinguish reflections written in this
      style from reflections written in a different style?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = So vague that any reflection could match; provides no real constraint.
      2 = Mostly vague; only one or two dimensions are specific enough to
          constrain output.
      3 = Moderately specific; several dimensions provide real constraint but
          others remain too loose.
      4 = Specific enough that most reflections written in this style would
          be recognizably different from other styles.
      5 = Highly specific across all dimensions; a reflection written in this
          style would be immediately distinguishable from other styles.
