_system_prompt: &system_prompt >
  You generate initial internal states for a gallery simulation. Follow the
  user's instructions exactly. Output only the state description: no
  preamble, no "Here is the state", no markdown.

_base_spec: &base_spec >
  Generate an initial internal state that describes a gallery visitor's inner
  condition at the moment they enter the gallery, before encountering any
  images.

  This state uses the same schema that will evolve throughout the visit. It
  represents a snapshot — how the viewer arrives today, not who they are in
  general.

  You MUST explicitly address each of the following 7 dimensions. All are
  qualitative, not numerical:

  1. Dominant mood — What is the prevailing affective tone? (e.g., calm,
  restless, melancholic, alert, apprehensive, buoyant, numb, wistful...)

  2. Underlying tension or ease — Beneath the surface mood, is there
  tightness, anticipation, resistance, or settled calm? What is the deeper
  felt texture?

  3. Energy and engagement (absorbed/energized ↔ depleted/fatigued) — What
  are the viewer's attentional and emotional reserves? Are they arriving
  fresh or already spent?

  4. Emotional openness (guarded/defended ↔ receptive/permeable) — How
  willing is the viewer to be affected by what comes next? Are their defenses
  up, or are they arriving porous?

  5. Attentional focus (narrow/concentrated ↔ diffuse/peripheral) — Is
  attention tightly directed and ready to lock in, or loose, drifting, and
  open to whatever enters?

  6. Meaning-making pressure (need-to-resolve ↔ letting-be) — Is there
  urgency to understand, categorize, or make sense of things? Or a capacity
  to let meaning remain suspended?

  7. Somatic activation (numb/quiet ↔ vivid/activated) — How present is
  the body in the experience? Are physical sensations faint and distant, or
  vivid and close?

  Write 3–5 sentences that cover all 7 dimensions. The description should
  feel like a momentary snapshot — how this person arrives today — not a
  stable personality description.

  Avoid:
  - references to any images
  - psychological theory or jargon
  - introductory phrases ("Here is the initial state:", "The state is:")
  - markdown formatting (no bold, no headers, no bullet points)

  Output ONLY the state description itself, starting directly with the
  content.
