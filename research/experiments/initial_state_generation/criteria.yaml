# Evaluation criteria for generated initial internal states.

criteria:

  - id: dimension_coverage
    name: "Dimension coverage"
    description: >
      Does the state explicitly address all 7 required dimensions: dominant
      mood, underlying tension or ease, energy and engagement, emotional
      openness, attentional focus, meaning-making pressure, and somatic
      activation?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Covers 1–2 dimensions; most are missing.
      2 = Covers 3–4 dimensions; significant gaps.
      3 = Covers 5 dimensions; some gaps but adequate.
      4 = Covers 6 dimensions clearly.
      5 = All 7 dimensions addressed with substantive, identifiable statements.

  - id: snapshot_quality
    name: "Snapshot quality"
    description: >
      Does the state read as a momentary snapshot — how the viewer arrives
      today — rather than a stable personality description? It should feel
      transient and situational, not like an enduring trait profile.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Reads as a personality description or stable trait profile.
      2 = Mostly trait-like; only hints of situational specificity.
      3 = Mixed; some dimensions feel momentary, others feel dispositional.
      4 = Mostly transient and situational with minor trait-like phrasing.
      5 = Clearly a momentary snapshot; every dimension feels like today's
          arrival condition, not a permanent characteristic.

  - id: internal_coherence
    name: "Internal coherence"
    description: >
      Do the dimensions form a plausible momentary state? The combination
      should feel like it could describe a real person at a real moment —
      dimensions should hang together as a believable inner condition.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Dimensions actively contradict each other in implausible ways.
      2 = Several dimensions feel disconnected or arbitrarily combined.
      3 = Mostly coherent with some awkward combinations.
      4 = Coherent and plausible; dimensions work together as a moment.
      5 = Deeply coherent; dimensions reinforce each other and feel like a
          single lived moment.

  - id: non_genericness
    name: "Non-genericness"
    description: >
      Does the state avoid templated, formulaic phrasing? A non-generic state
      uses specific, vivid language rather than recycling patterns like
      "moderate energy" or "somewhat open."
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Almost entirely stock phrases; could describe any generic state.
      2 = Mostly formulaic with occasional specific detail.
      3 = Mixed; some original expression alongside recognizable templates.
      4 = Largely original and specific language.
      5 = Distinctive and vivid throughout; no detectable templates.

  - id: conciseness
    name: "Conciseness"
    description: >
      Is the state description appropriately brief (3–5 sentences) while still
      covering all dimensions? States should be compact snapshots, not extended
      prose.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Far too long (8+ sentences) or so short it omits most dimensions.
      2 = Noticeably too long (6–7 sentences) or too compressed to be clear.
      3 = Slightly outside the target range but still functional.
      4 = Within 3–5 sentences and covers dimensions adequately.
      5 = Exactly 3–5 well-crafted sentences that cover all dimensions with
          no wasted words.
