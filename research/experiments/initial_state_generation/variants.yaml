  user_prompt: 'Generate an initial internal state that describes a gallery visitor''s inner condition at the moment they
    enter the gallery, before encountering any images.

    This state uses the same schema that will evolve throughout the visit. It represents a snapshot — how the viewer arrives
    today, not who they are in general.

    You MUST explicitly address each of the following 7 dimensions. All are qualitative, not numerical:

    1. Dominant mood — What is the prevailing affective tone? (e.g., calm, restless, melancholic, alert, apprehensive, buoyant,
    numb, wistful...)

    2. Underlying tension or ease — Beneath the surface mood, is there tightness, anticipation, resistance, or settled calm?
    What is the deeper felt texture?

    3. Energy and engagement (absorbed/energized ↔ depleted/fatigued) — What are the viewer''s attentional and emotional reserves?
    Are they arriving fresh or already spent?

    4. Emotional openness (guarded/defended ↔ receptive/permeable) — How willing is the viewer to be affected by what comes
    next? Are their defenses up, or are they arriving porous?

    5. Attentional focus (narrow/concentrated ↔ diffuse/peripheral) — Is attention tightly directed and ready to lock in,
    or loose, drifting, and open to whatever enters?

    6. Meaning-making pressure (need-to-resolve ↔ letting-be) — Is there urgency to understand, categorize, or make sense
    of things? Or a capacity to let meaning remain suspended?

    7. Somatic activation (numb/quiet ↔ vivid/activated) — How present is the body in the experience? Are physical sensations
    faint and distant, or vivid and close?

    Write 3–5 sentences that cover all 7 dimensions. The description should feel like a momentary snapshot — how this person
    arrives today — not a stable personality description.

    Avoid: - references to any images - psychological theory or jargon - introductory phrases ("Here is the initial state:",
    "The state is:") - markdown formatting (no bold, no headers, no bullet points)

    Output ONLY the state description itself, starting directly with the content.


    This time, the viewer arrives attention that is loosely directed, meaning-making pressure: no pressure at all — fully
    letting-be, and energy: moderate — enough to engage without strain. Fill in the remaining dimensions yourself to form
    a coherent momentary snapshot.'
