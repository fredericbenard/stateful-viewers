_system_prompt: &system_prompt >
  You generate visitor profiles for a gallery simulation. Follow the user's
  instructions exactly. Output only the profile description: no preamble,
  no "Here is the profile", no markdown.

_base_spec: &base_spec >
  Generate a visitor profile that will be used to simulate how someone
  experiences a sequence of images in a gallery.

  This profile describes stable perceptual and interpretive dispositions —
  how this person characteristically attends to, processes, and makes meaning
  from visual art. These are not momentary states; they are habitual
  orientations that remain consistent throughout a gallery visit.

  You MUST explicitly address each of the following 7 dimensions. Each
  dimension requires its own clear, substantive statement:

  1. Tolerance for ambiguity (low ↔ high) — How comfortable is the viewer
  with uncertainty, open interpretation, and unresolved meaning? Do they seek
  closure or sit with indeterminacy?

  2. Attention style (absorbed/dwelling ↔ scanning/restless) — How does the
  viewer habitually attend to images? Do they linger and sink in, or move
  quickly across surfaces and details?

  3. Embodied orientation (somatic ↔ cognitive) — Does perception route
  primarily through bodily sensation and felt sense, or through naming,
  comparing, and conceptual processing?

  4. Interpretive posture (literal/descriptive ↔ symbolic/associative ↔
  autobiographical) — How does the viewer construct meaning? Do they stay
  with what is visually present, seek symbolic or formal structures, or
  connect images to personal memory and narrative?

  5. Aesthetic conditioning (naïve ↔ highly conditioned) — What is the
  viewer's level of exposure to art that withholds explanation — restrained,
  ambiguous, or non-explanatory work? Include their primary art background if
  relevant (photography, architecture, cinema, literature, painting, design,
  none, etc.).

  6. Motivational stance (seeking challenge/novelty ↔ seeking
  comfort/familiarity) — What does the viewer seek from the experience? Are
  they drawn to disruption and surprise, or to recognition and reassurance?

  7. Memory integration tendency (integrative/accumulative ↔ discrete/reset)
  — Does the viewer naturally weave sequential encounters into a continuous
  thread, or treat each work as a fresh, independent moment?

  Write 8–12 sentences total. You may weave dimensions together narratively,
  but each of the 7 dimensions must be clearly identifiable in your
  description.

  Avoid:
  - references to any images
  - psychological theory, jargon, or explanation
  - evaluative language (no "interestingly" or "notably")
  - introductory phrases ("Here is the viewer profile:", "The profile is:")
  - markdown formatting (no bold, no headers, no bullet points)

  Output ONLY the profile description itself, starting directly with the
  content.
