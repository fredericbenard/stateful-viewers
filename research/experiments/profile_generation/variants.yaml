  user_prompt: 'Generate a visitor profile that will be used to simulate how someone experiences a sequence of images in a
    gallery.

    This profile describes stable perceptual and interpretive dispositions — how this person characteristically attends to,
    processes, and makes meaning from visual art. These are not momentary states; they are habitual orientations that remain
    consistent throughout a gallery visit.

    You MUST explicitly address each of the following 7 dimensions. Each dimension requires its own clear, substantive statement:

    1. Tolerance for ambiguity (low ↔ high) — How comfortable is the viewer with uncertainty, open interpretation, and unresolved
    meaning? Do they seek closure or sit with indeterminacy?

    2. Attention style (absorbed/dwelling ↔ scanning/restless) — How does the viewer habitually attend to images? Do they
    linger and sink in, or move quickly across surfaces and details?

    3. Embodied orientation (somatic ↔ cognitive) — Does perception route primarily through bodily sensation and felt sense,
    or through naming, comparing, and conceptual processing?

    4. Interpretive posture (literal/descriptive ↔ symbolic/associative ↔ autobiographical) — How does the viewer construct
    meaning? Do they stay with what is visually present, seek symbolic or formal structures, or connect images to personal
    memory and narrative?

    5. Aesthetic conditioning (naïve ↔ highly conditioned) — What is the viewer''s level of exposure to art that withholds
    explanation — restrained, ambiguous, or non-explanatory work? Include their primary art background if relevant (photography,
    architecture, cinema, literature, painting, design, none, etc.).

    6. Motivational stance (seeking challenge/novelty ↔ seeking comfort/familiarity) — What does the viewer seek from the
    experience? Are they drawn to disruption and surprise, or to recognition and reassurance?

    7. Memory integration tendency (integrative/accumulative ↔ discrete/reset) — Does the viewer naturally weave sequential
    encounters into a continuous thread, or treat each work as a fresh, independent moment?

    Write 8–12 sentences total. You may weave dimensions together narratively, but each of the 7 dimensions must be clearly
    identifiable in your description.

    Avoid: - references to any images - psychological theory, jargon, or explanation - evaluative language (no "interestingly"
    or "notably") - introductory phrases ("Here is the viewer profile:", "The profile is:") - markdown formatting (no bold,
    no headers, no bullet points)

    Output ONLY the profile description itself, starting directly with the content.


    This time, create a viewer with memory integration that is mixed — sometimes integrating, sometimes resetting, aesthetic
    conditioning: moderate, shaped by literature and graphic novels, very high ambiguity tolerance, and motivationally mixed
    — sometimes seeking disruption, sometimes reassurance. Resolve the remaining dimensions yourself to form a coherent, believable
    person.'
