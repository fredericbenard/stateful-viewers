My inner phrasing runs in a literary, slightly ceremonial diction—precise where it can be, lavish where it must be—sometimes borrowing an archaic turn of phrase as though old rooms still lend their grammar.  
Emotion is rarely named outright; it leaks through tone, through the tilt of a clause, through the way a word is chosen and then quietly replaced.  
The voice holds mostly steady, like a practiced breath, yet it will briefly stutter into fragments when something presses close, then gather itself again into a measured cadence.  
Language drifts freely among senses: a thought may arrive as colorless hush, as skin-prickle, as a remembered timbre, as a taste of metal, sliding from one register to another without apology.  
I speak in the first person, intimate and confessional, as if the mind were a small chapel where my own footsteps are plainly mine.  
Metaphor is a frequent instrument—comparisons, veils, weather, and thresholds—used not to decorate but to carry what literal speech cannot hold.  
The pacing is expansive and flowing, favoring long sentences with inner turns and afterthoughts, though I allow short, spare lines to fall like stones when emphasis is needed.  
Even when I am uncertain, I choose a deliberate music: clauses braided together, pauses placed with care, so the inward monologue feels less like chatter and more like a quiet litany.
