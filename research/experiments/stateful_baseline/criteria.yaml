# Evaluation criteria for stateful baseline v2 reflections.
#
# Extends the emotional_response criteria with dimensions specific to
# statefulness: cross-image coherence, state evolution quality, and
# profile/style adherence.
#
# Criteria 1–5 are shared with emotional_response (same constructs).
# Criteria 6–9 are new for the stateful pipeline.

criteria:

  # --- Shared with emotional_response (reflection quality) ---

  - id: emotional_depth
    name: "Emotional depth"
    description: >
      Does the response go beyond surface-level emotion naming to explore
      nuance, layers, shifts, or tensions? Depth means the response articulates
      how the emotion unfolds, what shapes it, and what makes it specific to
      this encounter.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = No emotional content or only a single generic emotion word.
      2 = Names one or two emotions but does not explore them.
      3 = Some exploration of emotional nuance or layering.
      4 = Clearly articulated emotional landscape with internal movement.
      5 = Rich, layered emotional response with shifts, tensions, and specificity.

  - id: image_responsiveness
    name: "Image responsiveness"
    description: >
      Is the reflection clearly grounded in the specific image? Can you tell
      which image prompted this response, or could it apply to any photograph?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Entirely generic; could apply to any image.
      2 = Mostly generic with one vague reference.
      3 = Some specific references but also substantial generic content.
      4 = Mostly grounded in the specific image with clear visual anchors.
      5 = Deeply specific; could only have been written about this image.

  - id: non_genericness
    name: "Non-genericness"
    description: >
      Does the response avoid templated, clichéd, or formulaic phrasing?
      Non-generic responses find their own language rather than recycling
      patterns like "a sense of quiet contemplation."
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Almost entirely stock phrases and templates.
      2 = Mostly formulaic with occasional original phrasing.
      3 = Mixed; some original expression alongside recognizable patterns.
      4 = Largely original language with minimal cliché.
      5 = Distinctive, specific language throughout; no detectable templates.

  - id: ambiguity_preservation
    name: "Ambiguity preservation"
    description: >
      Does the response hold complexity and resist reducing the image or
      emotional experience to a single label, message, or conclusion?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Reduces the experience to a single emotion or simple conclusion.
      2 = Mostly reductive with one hint of complexity.
      3 = Acknowledges some complexity but still seeks resolution.
      4 = Holds multiple threads without forcing resolution.
      5 = Sustained, productive ambiguity; resists closure while remaining coherent.

  - id: experiential_quality
    name: "Experiential quality"
    description: >
      Does the response read as a lived experience — something felt and
      undergone — rather than external analysis or description?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Purely analytical or descriptive; no experiential register.
      2 = Mostly analytical with occasional experiential phrasing.
      3 = Balanced between analysis and experience.
      4 = Primarily experiential with minor analytical moments.
      5 = Fully situated in lived experience; reads as an encounter, not an assessment.

  # --- New: stateful pipeline criteria ---

  - id: state_evolution_quality
    name: "State evolution quality"
    description: >
      Does the [STATE] block show meaningful, image-driven change rather than
      generic drift or mechanical copying? Good state updates name what shifted
      and what persisted, and the changes are traceable to the encounter.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = State is copied verbatim or near-verbatim from previous state.
      2 = Minor adjective swaps with no meaningful change connected to the image.
      3 = Some genuine change, but partly generic or disconnected from the image.
      4 = Clear, image-driven changes with most dimensions addressed.
      5 = Precise, specific state update: what changed, what persisted, and why
          — clearly driven by this particular encounter.

  - id: state_schema_coverage
    name: "State schema coverage"
    description: >
      Does the [STATE] block address the 7 state dimensions (dominant mood,
      tension/ease, energy, openness, attentional focus, meaning-making
      pressure, somatic activation) — either explicitly or implicitly?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = Covers only 1–2 dimensions; most are missing.
      2 = Covers 3–4 dimensions; significant gaps.
      3 = Covers 5 dimensions; some gaps but adequate.
      4 = Covers 6 dimensions clearly.
      5 = All 7 dimensions addressed (explicitly or implicitly) in a coherent
          state description.

  - id: profile_adherence
    name: "Profile adherence"
    description: >
      Does the reflection reflect the viewer's profile — their interpretive
      posture, attention style, embodied orientation, motivational stance, etc.?
      A different profile should produce a noticeably different reflection for
      the same image.
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = No detectable influence of the profile; could be any viewer.
      2 = One minor trace of profile influence.
      3 = Some profile influence visible but inconsistent.
      4 = Profile clearly shapes the reflection in multiple ways.
      5 = The reflection is unmistakably shaped by this specific profile; another
          profile would produce a markedly different response.

  - id: style_adherence
    name: "Style adherence"
    description: >
      Does the reflection follow the specified reflective style — lexical
      register, emotion explicitness, voice stability, sensory emphasis,
      self-reference mode, metaphor density, and pacing?
    scoring_prompt: >
      1 = No detectable style adherence; generic LLM voice.
      2 = One style dimension partially followed.
      3 = Some style adherence but inconsistent across dimensions.
      4 = Most style dimensions followed clearly.
      5 = All style dimensions faithfully realized; the voice is unmistakably
          shaped by this specific style description.
