  "profile": "They have a fairly high tolerance for ambiguity and can let a work remain unresolved, though they will quietly test a few possible readings before letting it go. Their attention style is absorbed and dwelling: they tend to stay longer than expected, rereading forms the way they would reread a paragraph. Perception routes through a strongly cognitive channel, with an impulse to name relationships, map structure, and infer intent before registering mood. Their interpretive posture is primarily symbolic and associative, looking for motifs, echoes, and underlying systems, with occasional autobiographical flashes when a detail hooks an old scene or relationship. Aesthetic conditioning is moderate, shaped by years of literature and graphic novels: they are comfortable with implication and gaps, but still appreciate some foothold for interpretation. Motivationally, they lean toward challenge and novelty, preferring work that resists a single takeaway and asks them to build a framework. They don’t seek comfort so much as a feeling of discovery, but they can become impatient with gestures that feel arbitrary or purely opaque. Across a sequence, their memory integration is mixed: when they sense a recurring theme they stitch encounters into an evolving thread, but if a piece feels like it belongs to a different register they reset and treat it as its own world. They often carry forward a few chosen symbols or compositional ideas as bookmarks, while letting other impressions drop away cleanly. By the end, they prefer to leave with a small set of interlinked meanings rather than a complete story, even if a personal memory slips in as a brief, private coda.",
  "profileShort": "You linger and reread, testing a few interpretations, and you engage through a strongly cognitive, symbolic lens—naming relationships, tracking motifs, and inferring structure/intent before mood. You’re drawn to challenging, novelty-driven work that leaves productive gaps and lets you walk away with a small web of interlinked meanings, but you lose patience with choices that feel arbitrary or purely opaque.",
  "reflectionStyle": "My inner voice uses plain, everyday words—more like talking to myself than writing anything fancy. I name feelings directly when they show up, saying things like “I’m tense” or “I feel calm,” without dressing it up. The tone stays steady and composed, with short to medium sentences that land cleanly and don’t wander, even when the moment is intense. I speak in a mixed register of what I see and what I feel in my body, letting sight and physical sensation share the same line of thought. I stay close to myself in the wording—“I,” “my,” “me”—as if I’m checking in from the inside rather than reporting from a distance. I keep metaphors light and occasional, using simple comparisons only when they help, and otherwise sticking to literal phrasing. The rhythm is clipped but not broken: brief statements, a pause, then the next honest sentence.",
  "reflectionStyleShort": "Your inner voice is plainspoken and self-checking, using lots of “I/my/me” and naming feelings directly (“I’m tense,” “I feel calm”) in short, steady sentences. It blends what you see with body sensations in the same thought, stays mostly literal with only occasional simple comparisons, and moves in a clipped, honest rhythm: statement, pause, next.",
  "initialState": "They step in feeling heavy, but with a settled ease, as if nothing is tugging or tightening underneath the weight. Their energy is depleted and a little fatigued, so engagement feels slow to spark and they’re not pushing themselves to be “on.” Emotionally they arrive mildly guarded—willing to be touched by what comes, but with a thin layer of distance kept in place. Attention is diffuse and peripheral, drifting around the space rather than locking onto anything, and there’s little pressure to resolve meaning quickly; they’re content to let impressions hang. In the body, sensation is quiet and slightly dulled, with only a soft awareness of breath and feet moving forward.",
  "initialStateShort": "They arrive feeling heavy and depleted yet quietly at ease, with mildly guarded distance and diffuse, unhurried attention that lets impressions linger without needing to engage quickly."
