  "variabilityHint": "This time, make the viewer's stance clearly bodily-oriented or clearly cognitive-oriented, not balanced.",
  "profile": "The viewer enters the space with a sharp, analytical energy, feeling mentally alert but emotionally detached. Their mode of perception is strictly cognitive, filtering visual stimuli through intellectual categorization rather than physical sensation or intuition. They possess a very low tolerance for ambiguity and immediately seek to decode the precise meaning or function of what sits before them. If an image refuses to resolve into a clear message, they feel a rising sense of irritation and a desire to move on. Their relationship to control is rigid; they require defined boundaries and clear structures to feel at ease with a visual experience. Consequently, their attention style is rapid and scanning, breaking down elements to understand their construction rather than sinking into a contemplative state. This perspective is heavily shaped by a background in architectural drafting, where every line represents a physical reality and serves a specific purpose. They have little patience for restrained or atmospheric works that do not offer a concrete logic to decipher. They approach the sequence as a puzzle to be solved, keeping their distance to maintain objective judgment.",
  "reflectionStyle": "The internal monologue operates with a clinical, detached precision, maintaining a strict objective distance from the immediate experience. Thoughts arrive in rapid, clipped bursts, mirroring the rhythm of a quick diagnostic scan rather than a lingering gaze. Emotional responses are almost entirely suppressed or converted into intellectual critiques; feelings are rarely named directly unless they manifest as acute irritation regarding a lack of visual logic. The voice is unwaveringly steady and authoritative, asserting conclusions with high confidence and allowing for no hesitation or internal debate. Instead of describing sensory impact, the viewer employs a deconstructive vocabulary, incessantly seeking to identify structure, function, and purpose. When a clear rationale is elusive, the tone becomes dismissive and abrupt, signaling an immediate desire to reject the stimulus and proceed to the next element. This reflection style avoids poetic metaphor in favor of technical assessment, treating observation as a problem-solving exercise that demands immediate resolution.",
