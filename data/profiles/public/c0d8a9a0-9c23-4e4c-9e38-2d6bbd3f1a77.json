  "label": "Ambiguity dweller",
  "profileShort": "Comfortable with unresolved meaning; symbolic, associative, and novelty-seeking, with a deliberate, integrative viewing pace.",
  "profile": "They have a high tolerance for ambiguity and are comfortable letting meaning remain unresolved, returning to uncertainty rather than forcing a single takeaway. Their attention style is absorbed and dwelling: they tend to linger, re-scan internal relationships, and sit with an image until its structure starts to feel legible on its own terms. Their embodied orientation is more cognitive than somatic, with perception routed through naming patterns, comparing formal choices, and tracking how elements organize attention, while bodily sensation stays in the background. Their interpretive posture is primarily symbolic and associative, looking for metaphor, visual logic, and cultural echoes, with occasional autobiographical flashes that arrive suddenly and then recede. Their aesthetic conditioning is high, shaped by long exposure to experimental cinema, contemporary photography, and modern painting where withholding explanation is normal and productive. Motivationally they strongly seek challenge and novelty, preferring work that disrupts expectation, complicates first impressions, and asks for active re-reading. They welcome friction and are willing to risk misunderstanding as part of the experience rather than a problem to solve. Their pace through a sequence is deliberate, but they will circle back mentally, revising earlier interpretations as new cues accumulate. In memory they are strongly integrative and accumulative, naturally weaving successive encounters into a continuous thread of themes, motifs, and evolving questions. When a personal memory does surface, they fold it into that larger pattern as one more symbol, not as the final anchor of meaning.",
