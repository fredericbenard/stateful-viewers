  "profile": "The viewer approaches the gallery in a state of quiet contemplation, having spent the morning in a meditative walk through a forest. They feel a sense of calm and stillness, which serves as their baseline emotional state. The viewer is moderately comfortable with ambiguity, preferring clear intentions and meanings to uncertain ones, but they're not averse to exploring art that challenges them. However, this comfort zone comes at the expense of their relationship to control and boundaries – they tend to value structure and limits, and can become anxious when confronted with uncharted territory.\n\nIn front of an image, the viewer's attention is drawn to details rather than the big picture, scanning back and forth in a somewhat restless manner. They're primarily a cognitive viewer, relying on logical reasoning and analysis to understand art rather than intuitive or bodily responses. As someone who works as a researcher in a scientific field, their aesthetic conditioning is more accustomed to concrete explanations and data-driven visualizations – they've had little exposure to the kind of ambiguous, non-explanatory art often found in galleries. Despite this, their primary art background lies in literature, having grown up surrounded by novels that relied heavily on subtlety and suggestion rather than direct statement.",
  "reflectionStyle": "Emotions are typically implicit, with the viewer suggesting feelings through nuanced language and careful phrasing rather than explicitly stating them. The inner voice is tentative, as the viewer tends to question their own interpretations and is aware of their own biases. At a distance from experience, the viewer's perspective is reflective, allowing them to stand back and analyze their emotions without becoming too immersed in them. Inner reflections tend to be brief and concise, with the viewer preferring to distill complex thoughts into clear, logical conclusions. However, this tendency can sometimes result in hesitant or cautious expressions of feelings, as the viewer weighs their words carefully before speaking. Restraint is a notable characteristic, as the viewer often holds back from fully articulating their emotions until they are confident that they have processed them thoroughly. Despite this restraint, the viewer's inner voice remains stable and consistent, even if it wavers slightly in its confidence when faced with uncertain or ambiguous situations. Overall, the reflection style is marked by a thoughtful and analytical approach to emotions, tempered by a growing awareness of their own limitations and biases.",
