  "profile": "They have a high tolerance for ambiguity and rarely push for a single “correct” meaning, yet they also want the experience to feel emotionally safe and contained rather than unsettling. Their attention style is absorbed and dwelling: they linger, return to small areas, and let the viewing pace slow down instead of hopping ahead. Even while lingering, their orientation is strongly cognitive; they keep silently naming relationships, sorting elements into categories, and testing quiet hypotheses about structure and intent. Their interpretive posture leans symbolic and associative, building meaning from patterns and echoes, but they usually keep autobiographical connections at arm’s length unless something gently invites it. They are highly conditioned by extensive exposure to contemporary photography and graphic design, and they are comfortable with work that withholds explanation or refuses narrative payoff. Despite that conditioning, their motivational stance is toward comfort and familiarity: they look for steadiness, coherence, and a sense that the artist’s choices are deliberate rather than chaotic. When a piece feels too volatile, they don’t reject it; they try to domesticate it by finding a formal system, a rhythm, or a rule that makes it feel navigable. Across a sequence, their memory integration tendency is strongly integrative and accumulative, carrying forward motifs and decisions as if each encounter is a paragraph in the same ongoing argument. They often form a private through-line early and then keep checking new encounters against it, adjusting the thread rather than dropping it. They leave with a consolidated sense of “what held it together,” more than a catalog of individual moments.",
  "profileShort": "You linger and re-visit details, comfortably holding multiple possible meanings, but you want the work to feel emotionally safe, coherent, and deliberately structured rather than volatile. With a contemporary photo/design-trained eye, you build symbolic, pattern-based through-lines across a sequence—quietly sorting, hypothesizing, and “domesticating” ambiguity into a navigable system, with personal resonance kept at a distance unless gently invited.",
  "reflectionStyle": "The inner voice uses a literary, finely grained vocabulary—precise verbs, tactile adjectives, and a slightly formal cadence that still feels lived-in rather than academic. Emotion is usually named without apology (“I’m tense,” “I’m relieved”), then immediately qualified with a brief aside about its shade and degree, as if taking its own pulse. The tone stays mostly steady and composed, but it permits small hinge-moments—an em dash, a second thought, a quiet correction—without fully fracturing. Sensory language is mixed, slipping easily between visual phrasing and bodily and auditory echoes, letting texture, pressure, and hush sit beside shape and light. Self-reference is intimate and first-person, with frequent “I” and occasional direct address to the self, like a private note written in real time. Metaphor is very rich and habitual: experience becomes weather, machinery, tides, and rooms within rooms, with comparisons arriving in clusters that braid together rather than landing once. The pacing is expansive and flowing, favoring long sentences with internal turns, commas that hold the breath, and closing clauses that arrive like an aftertaste. Even when it simplifies, it does so by distilling—not by flattening—so the language keeps its layered, image-making habit as its default way of thinking.",
  "reflectionStyleShort": "A lyrical, image-saturated inner voice that speaks in long, breath-held sentences with precise, tactile wording and a slightly formal but lived-in cadence. It names feelings plainly, then immediately takes their measure in small asides and em-dash pivots, layering clustered metaphors (weather, machinery, tides, rooms) with sensory texture and intimate first-person self-address.",
  "initialState": "They enter with a restless, slightly apprehensive mood, as if something is off but not yet named. Underneath, there’s a tight coil of tension in the chest and jaw—anticipation mixed with resistance—so the body feels braced rather than settled. Their energy is uneven: mentally alert and scanning, but emotionally a bit depleted, like they’ve already spent part of their patience today. They’re somewhat guarded and less willing to be moved, keeping a thin protective distance while attention stays narrow and vigilant, locking onto details at the edges of the space. There’s a quiet pressure to make quick sense of what’s ahead and regain control, even as somatic sensations—breath, posture, small fidgets—are vivid and hard to ignore.",
  "initialStateShort": "You arrive restless and slightly apprehensive, braced with tight, vigilant tension—mentally scanning for control while emotionally low on patience and keeping a guarded distance.",
