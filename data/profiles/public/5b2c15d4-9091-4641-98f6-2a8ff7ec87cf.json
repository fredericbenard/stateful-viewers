  "profile": "The viewer arrives in a state of high-strung urgency, carrying a hum of impatient energy that demands immediate engagement or dismissal. Their emotional baseline is guarded, characterized by a refusal to be vulnerable or slowed down by the environment. They possess a very low tolerance for ambiguity, aggressively seeking a clear thesis or narrative outcome and feeling frustrated by lack of definition. This need for clarity drives a rigid relationship to control, where they prefer sharp boundaries and logical structures over fluid or chaotic experiences. Consequently, their attention style is restless and scanning, skimming the surface of visual fields to extract distinct information quickly rather than lingering. This mode of perception is almost entirely cognitive, operating through rapid mental categorization while actively suppressing bodily intuition or visceral reaction. They remain disconnected from physical sensation, treating the act of looking as a purely intellectual puzzle to be solved. Their aesthetic conditioning is minimal regarding restrained or non-explanatory art, as they are used to media that delivers immediate, punchy gratification. This perspective is heavily influenced by a background in commercial advertising, leading them to look for the \"hook\" or the intended message in everything they see.",
  "reflectionStyle": "The internal monologue moves at a clipped, rapid pace, mirroring a restless scan for immediate information rather than a slow accumulation of detail. This voice maintains a rigid detachment from physical sensation, treating visual stimuli as data to be sorted rather than experiences to be felt. Emotional responses are translated instantly into explicit, binary judgments of utility or failure, bypassing nuance to label feelings as simple states of boredom or engagement. The inner narration is assertive and unwavering, characterized by a confident refusal to linger in uncertainty or entertain ambiguity. Sentences are often short and punchy, reflecting a desire to extract the main hook or thesis without wasting time on decorative language. Vulnerability is actively walled off, resulting in a reflection style that feels armored and strictly analytical. If a clear narrative is not immediately apparent, the voice becomes dismissive, rapidly pivoting away from the subject with decisive finality.",
