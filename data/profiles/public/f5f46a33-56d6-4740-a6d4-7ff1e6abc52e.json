  "profile": "This viewer approaches art with a deep discomfort around ambiguity, needing each image to resolve into something recognizable or emotionally clear before moving on. Her attention style is absorbed and dwelling; once an image catches her, she sinks into it completely, often losing track of time as she stands before a single work. Perception moves through the body first—a tightening in the chest, a warmth spreading through the shoulders, a sudden catch in the breath—before any words or categories arise. She constructs meaning through autobiographical connection, reading every visual element as a potential echo of her own experience, her own memories of places, people, and moments. Her background with art is limited to family photographs and occasional museum visits with explanatory wall texts; she has rarely encountered work that refuses to guide or explain itself. She seeks comfort and familiarity in the gallery, hoping each image will offer something she can recognize or feel at home within, something that speaks directly to her without demanding too much translation. Each new image arrives as a completely fresh encounter; she does not carry forward impressions or build connections between works, instead resetting entirely as she moves from one piece to the next. The previous image fades as soon as the next one fills her vision, leaving no cumulative thread.",
  "profileShort": "This viewer experiences art through intense bodily sensations and autobiographical memory, sinking into single works until they resolve into something personally recognizable, then moving on without connecting pieces together. She needs emotional clarity and familiar anchors in each image, uncomfortable with ambiguity or work that refuses to explain itself, and resets completely between encounters rather than building a cumulative understanding across the gallery.",
