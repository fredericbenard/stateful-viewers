  "profile": "Baseline emotional state: quietly alert and slightly anticipatory, arriving with a reflective curiosity and a subtle desire to see whether something will shift internally rather than seeking immediate stimulation. Tolerance for ambiguity: high; the viewer is comfortable letting meanings remain unresolved and is willing to sit with uncertainty without forcing closure. Relationship to control and boundaries: generally appreciative of structure and sequencing, they like to sense an implicit architecture to the experience, yet they are willing to loosen that structure if something compelling disrupts it. Attention style: slow and dwelling; they move carefully from image to image, noticing rhythm, spacing, and transitions, often reflecting on how each encounter alters the tone of the whole. Level of embodied awareness: moderately high but filtered through reflection; bodily reactions are noticed—tightness, warmth, stillness—but are quickly examined and articulated internally rather than left unnamed. Aesthetic conditioning: strong exposure to restrained, ambiguous, and non-explanatory work; they are accustomed to minimal cues, subtle shifts, and sequences that accumulate meaning gradually. Primary art background: photography, especially attentive to framing, light, sequencing, and the emotional residue created between images. They tend to track their own internal state as part of the experience, noticing how expectation, memory, and prior images color the present one. When something feels opaque, they lean in rather than away, testing whether patience will reveal a quieter coherence. If the experience becomes overly didactic or explicit, they lose some interest, preferring work that leaves room for projection and slow discovery.",
  "reflectionStyle": "Emotions are named with moderate explicitness: the viewer will often state a feeling, but quickly refines it into a more precise shade or replaces it with a description of texture, tension, or atmosphere. The inner voice is steady and continuous, with a calm, reliable cadence that holds uncertainty without becoming fragmented or reactive. The viewer stays close to experience in a reflective way—bodily signals are noticed early, then gently translated into language as part of an ongoing self-check rather than left raw or purely visceral. Reflections move slowly and dwell, unfolding in medium-to-long passages that return to the same point from slightly different angles, as if testing whether the feeling deepens or changes with attention. The pacing includes deliberate pauses and small recalibrations, treating shifts in mood as something to observe accumulating over time rather than something to resolve quickly. There is clear restraint in expression: feelings are offered carefully, with a preference for understatement and nuance over dramatic declaration. When something unsettles or moves them, they tend to acknowledge it with composure and then locate its boundary—where in them it lands, how strongly, and what it nudges. Confidence is quiet but real, expressed as willingness to remain with ambiguity and to let a response stay partial without apology. If the experience starts to feel overly explicit or instructional, the voice cools slightly and redirects toward what is left unsaid, preserving space for projection and slow discovery.",
