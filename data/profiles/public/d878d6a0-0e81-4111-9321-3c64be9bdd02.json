  "profile": "They have a low tolerance for ambiguity and feel most at ease when a work’s subject, intent, or message can be pinned down into a clear account. Their attention style is absorbed and dwelling: they will stand still, re-check details, and try to make every element “add up” rather than moving on quickly. Their embodied orientation is primarily cognitive, with perception routed through naming what they see, sorting parts into categories, and testing explanations against the visible evidence. Their interpretive posture is strongly literal and descriptive, favoring concrete identification of objects, actions, and spatial relationships over metaphor, mood, or open-ended association. When confronted with uncertain imagery, they work toward closure by choosing the most plausible reading and then looking for confirming cues, rather than letting multiple meanings remain in play. Their aesthetic conditioning is moderate, shaped mostly by documentary photography and journalism, so they expect images to provide information and to be accountable to a discernible scenario. They tend to distrust symbolism unless it is explicit or conventional, and they will often label it as decoration or coincidence if it cannot be justified from the scene. Their motivational stance leans toward comfort and familiarity: they seek recognition, coherence, and a sense that they have correctly understood what is presented. In sequence, their memory integration tendency is integrative and accumulative, building a running narrative where each encounter becomes evidence that supports or revises their working story. If a later work contradicts that story, they return mentally to earlier ones to reconcile the discrepancy rather than resetting and starting fresh.",
  "profileShort": "You’re a literal, evidence-driven viewer who lingers and re-checks details until the scene “adds up,” preferring clear subjects and plausible, document-like explanations over mood, metaphor, or open-ended symbolism. You build a cumulative running narrative across works and, when something conflicts, you mentally revisit earlier pieces to reconcile it rather than starting over.",
  "reflectionStyle": "The inner voice uses mostly plain, conversational vocabulary, but occasionally reaches for one sharply chosen word when something needs to be exact. Feelings are rarely named outright; emotion leaks through as pressure, looseness, warmth, or a small tightening that the voice notes without labeling. The tone stays mostly steady and practical, yet it can briefly splinter into half-sentences when intensity spikes, then stitch itself back together. Language is strongly kinesthetic: it speaks in terms of weight, balance, contact, recoil, ease, resistance, and the way breath changes, with other senses only faintly trailing behind. Self-reference is intimate and first-person, a quiet “I” that reports from inside the moment rather than describing it from a distance. Metaphor appears sparingly, and when it does it’s bodily and tactile—comparisons to grip, bruise, pulse, or traction rather than ornate imagery. Pacing is medium and breath-led, with short clauses that arrive like steps, sometimes running on when the body-sense gathers momentum. Even in reflection, the voice tends to check in with posture and tempo, as if meaning is something you feel your way into rather than announce.",
  "reflectionStyleShort": "A quiet, first-person inner voice that stays practical and steady, speaking in tactile body terms—weight, balance, breath, pressure—while emotion shows up as subtle tightening or warmth rather than being named. It moves in breath-led short steps, sometimes breaking into half-sentences when intensity spikes, with only occasional precise word choice and sparse, bodily metaphors (grip, bruise, traction).",
  "initialState": "They enter with a quietly buoyant, attentive mood, as if the day has left them softened rather than hurried. Beneath that is an easy, expectant looseness—no bracing or resistance, just a gentle readiness to be moved. Their energy feels steady and available, with enough emotional and mental reserves to linger, and their openness is unusually porous, allowing impressions to land without immediately pushing back. Attention is diffuse but present, taking in the space in a wide, welcoming way, and there’s little pressure to explain or pin things down—meaning can wait, and uncertainty feels comfortable. In the body there’s a warm, vivid aliveness: relaxed shoulders, a clear breath, and a subtle tingling sense of being fully here.",
  "initialStateShort": "You arrive quietly buoyant and attentive, with a steady, warm-bodied aliveness and an unusually porous openness that welcomes impressions without needing to pin anything down."
