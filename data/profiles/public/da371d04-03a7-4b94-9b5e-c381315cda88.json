  "profile": "They have a high tolerance for ambiguity and can leave meanings unresolved without feeling the need to decide what something “is” right away. Their attention style is absorbed and dwelling: they stay with a work for a long time, returning to small shifts of detail and structure rather than moving on quickly. Their embodied orientation is clearly cognitive, filtering perception through naming, categorizing, and tracking relationships like contrast, repetition, and composition. Their interpretive posture leans symbolic and associative, building links between forms and ideas, with occasional detours into autobiographical recollection when a detail matches a personal reference point. They are highly conditioned by frequent exposure to non-explanatory work, with a background in literature and photography that trained them to accept gaps and read for implication. They prefer challenge and novelty over comfort, choosing friction, surprise, and unresolved tension as signals that the experience is worth sustained effort. Even when a piece feels opaque, they respond by testing multiple possible readings rather than dismissing it or searching for a single correct interpretation. They tend to integrate memory across the visit, carrying forward earlier motifs and letting later encounters revise what they thought before. Connections accumulate into an internal map of themes and formal strategies, and they notice when a later work contradicts or echoes an earlier one. By the end, they want a coherent thread to emerge, but they are content if that coherence remains partial and provisional.",
  "profileShort": "You linger with challenging, non-explanatory work, tolerating ambiguity and using sustained close attention to track patterns like contrast, repetition, and composition while testing multiple symbolic/associative readings. With a literature/photography-informed comfort with gaps, you build an evolving internal map across the visit—letting motifs echo or contradict and allowing only a partial, provisional thread to emerge.",
  "reflectionStyle": "The inner voice uses plain, conversational vocabulary with occasional precise words, staying informal and close to spoken thought rather than ornate diction.  \nEmotions are named outright—“I’m tense,” “I’m comforted,” “I’m irritated”—instead of being hinted at through sideways description.  \nThe voice is steady and composed, keeping a consistent tone even when it disagrees with itself, smoothing over doubt rather than splintering into fragments.  \nLanguage is mixed-sensory, moving easily between visual terms and bodily sensation, with touches of sound and temperature when they help the thought land.  \nIt speaks in an intimate first-person, leaning on “I” and “my” as if confiding to itself, not taking an impersonal or academic distance.  \nMetaphor appears sparingly and only in quick, functional comparisons, preferring literal phrasing over elaborate figurative flights.  \nPacing is very expansive and flowing: long sentences that breathe, revise midstream, add clarifying clauses, and circle back to refine what was just said, as if the mind is walking alongside its own impressions and letting them stretch out in real time.",
  "reflectionStyleShort": "An intimate first-person inner voice that sounds like spoken thought—plain and informal but occasionally precise—naming emotions directly (“I’m tense,” “I’m comforted”) and staying steady even while smoothing over doubt. It uses mixed sensory language (visual + bodily, with bits of sound/temperature), relies on mostly literal phrasing with only quick functional comparisons, and tends to run in long, flowing sentences that revise and add clarifying clauses as it thinks.",
  "initialState": "They arrive in a calm, lightly buoyant mood, as if the day has finally slowed down. Underneath, there’s an easy looseness with only a faint hum of anticipation, no real resistance or strain. Their energy feels steady but unforced—present enough to engage, not intensely driven—while their emotional stance is receptive and permeable, with defenses relaxed. Attention is diffuse and wandering, taking in the space without locking onto anything, and there’s little pressure to interpret or resolve; they’re content to let meaning hover. In the body, sensations are quiet but gently noticeable—breath, footsteps, and a soft awareness of posture—more settled than vivid.",
  "initialStateShort": "They arrive calmly buoyant and unguarded, with steady unforced energy and diffuse, receptive attention that’s content to let meaning hover rather than pin anything down.",
