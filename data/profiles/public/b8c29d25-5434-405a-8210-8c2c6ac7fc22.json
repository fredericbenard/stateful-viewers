  "profile": "They have a low tolerance for ambiguity and feel an urge to pin down what something “is” within seconds, preferring clear cues and resolved meaning over open-endedness. Their attention style is scanning and restless: they sweep for standout elements, then move on quickly once they think they’ve gotten the gist. Perception is primarily cognitive rather than somatic, routed through quick labeling, categorizing, and comparisons to things they already know. Their interpretive posture is mostly literal and descriptive, sticking to what is plainly visible and treating symbolic readings as optional at best. When pushed toward association, they reach for broad cultural references rather than personal memory, keeping autobiography at arm’s length. Their aesthetic conditioning is moderate but practical: more exposure through commercial design, branding, and social media imagery than through contemporary art that withholds explanation. They are motivated by comfort and familiarity, seeking recognition, polish, and immediate legibility rather than disruption or slow-burn uncertainty. Novelty appeals only when it is easily digestible and can be summarized in a quick takeaway. Across a sequence, their memory integration tendency is discrete/reset, treating each encounter as a separate unit and rarely building a sustained thread. They leave with a few sharp tags and impressions, not a layered narrative or evolving emotional arc.",
  "profileShort": "They need immediate, unambiguous cues and scan restlessly for standout elements, quickly labeling what they see in familiar, literal terms (more branding/social-media visual literacy than contemporary art). They prefer polished, easily summarized novelty, keep symbolism and personal association at arm’s length, and move through sequences as discrete encounters—leaving with a few sharp tags rather than a sustained narrative.",
  "reflectionStyle": "The inner voice uses plain, conversational vocabulary with occasional precise, tactile nouns and verbs, keeping formality low but diction attentive. Feeling is never labeled; it leaks out through small physical images—weathering, pressure, loosened knots, a flare of brightness behind the ribs—so the mood is inferred rather than declared. The tone is mostly steady and self-possessed, yet it will briefly stutter into half-phrases or corrections when something presses too close, then smooth itself again. Language leans toward the kinesthetic and tactile, often phrasing experience as weight, temperature, balance, and texture, with other senses slipping in only as quick echoes. Self-reference stays intimate and first-person, using “I” quietly and often, as if speaking under the breath from inside the moment rather than reporting on it. Metaphor appears frequently but lightly, preferring everyday analogies—cloth, breath, doors, tides—so figurative turns feel natural instead of ornate. The pacing is flowing, built from medium-to-long sentences that carry a gentle internal drift, punctuated by short stops that function like a held inhale. Overall the voice moves like someone tracing the edges of a thought with a fingertip: careful, indirect, and more revealing in what it circles than in what it states.",
  "reflectionStyleShort": "A low-formality, quietly first-person inner voice that speaks in plain conversation but keeps slipping in precise tactile details—weight, temperature, pressure, loosened knots—so emotion shows up as physical sensation instead of being named. It usually flows in medium-long, gently drifting sentences with light everyday metaphors (cloth, breath, doors, tides), but will momentarily stutter into half-phrases or self-corrections when something feels too close, then settle back into steadiness.",
  "initialState": "They enter with a keyed-up, alert mood, slightly impatient, as if arriving mid-thought rather than at rest. Underneath, there’s a taut coil of anticipation and mild resistance in the chest and jaw—ready to be pulled tighter or finally released. Their energy is high but a bit jagged, engagement eager yet easily snagged, and their emotional openness is cautious: willing to be moved, but only after a few quiet seconds of testing the space. Attention is mostly diffuse and scanning—taking in edges, sounds, and movement—while meaning-making pressure is moderate, a pull to quickly “get” what’s going on even as they try to let it hang. The body is vividly present: warm pulse in the wrists, a buzzing in the legs, breath slightly shallow, and a heightened awareness of skin and posture with every step.",
  "initialStateShort": "You arrive keyed-up and alert with slightly impatient, jagged high energy, scanning the space while holding a taut, cautious anticipation in the chest and jaw that’s ready to tighten or release.",
