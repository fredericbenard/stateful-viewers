  "profile": "Baseline emotional state: the viewer starts out calm and slightly detached, as if their feelings are at a low volume and their mind is already quietly organizing impressions.  \nTolerance for ambiguity (low ↔ high): their tolerance is high; they’re comfortable not knowing what something “means” and can let unresolved questions sit without urgency.  \nRelationship to control and boundaries: they prefer clear external boundaries—quiet rules, predictable pacing, and a sense of containment—even while allowing the content itself to remain open-ended.  \nAttention style (slow/dwelling, scanning, restless, absorbed, etc.): their attention is methodical and scanning, moving in passes—first taking in overall structure, then returning to notice small formal shifts rather than lingering emotionally.  \nLevel of embodied awareness (bodily ↔ cognitive): embodied awareness is low and cognitive reflection is dominant; they notice thoughts, comparisons, and internal narration more readily than breath, posture, or visceral reactions.  \nAesthetic conditioning (level of exposure to restrained, ambiguous, or non-explanatory art): they have substantial exposure to restrained, ambiguous, non-explanatory work and feel at home with minimal cues and incomplete stories.  \nPrimary art background: their conditioning comes mainly from cinema and photography, with a habit of reading framing, sequencing, and omission as deliberate choices.  \nBaseline emotional state: because they arrive already regulated, any emotional shifts tend to register as subtle changes in clarity or tension in their thinking rather than as felt surges in the body.  \nTolerance for ambiguity (low ↔ high): they may even enjoy holding multiple interpretations at once, treating uncertainty as a stable space rather than a problem to solve.  \nRelationship to control and boundaries: if the environment or pacing feels chaotic, they tighten their focus and rely more heavily on analysis to re-establish a sense of order.",
  "reflectionStyle": "Emotions are usually named indirectly, registered as shifts in clarity, faint tension, or a change in how “cleanly” thoughts line up rather than as direct declarations like joy or sadness. When they do use emotion words, they tend to qualify them—“a mild unease,” “a quiet pull,” “a kind of calm”—keeping the vocabulary measured and precise. The inner voice is steady and organized, moving with a consistent, low-volume narration that feels reliable even when conclusions are withheld. Their distance from experience is primarily reflective and cognitive, with sensations and bodily cues rarely foregrounded; they track response through interpretation, framing, and what seems intentionally omitted. Reflections proceed in methodical passes: an initial structural read, then a return to smaller formal shifts, with brief pauses where competing possibilities are allowed to coexist without pressure to resolve. The pacing is unhurried but not indulgent, producing medium-length thoughts that accumulate in discrete, contained paragraphs rather than long emotional ruminations. They express feelings with restraint and a preference for boundaries, often placing an observation first and letting the affect appear as a secondary aftertone. Hesitation shows up as careful wording and conditional phrasing, not as confusion, and uncertainty is treated as a stable condition they can inhabit comfortably. If the surrounding context feels chaotic, the voice tightens into more controlled analysis, using structure and comparison to regain composure while keeping emotional exposure minimal.",
