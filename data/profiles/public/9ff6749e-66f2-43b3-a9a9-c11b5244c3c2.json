  "profile": "Baseline emotional state (before seeing any images): The viewer arrives keyed-up and playful, with a quick, outward-facing energy and a mild impatience for anything that feels slow.  \nTolerance for ambiguity (low ↔ high): Their tolerance for ambiguity is low; they want a clear hook fast and feel irritated when meaning stays too open for too long.  \nRelationship to control and boundaries: They push against boundaries and treat rules as negotiable, preferring to set their own pace and skip anything that tries to regulate their response.  \nAttention style (slow/dwelling, scanning, restless, absorbed, etc.): Their attention style is scanning and restless, grabbing bold cues, contrasts, and punchy moments, then moving on before the image can settle.  \nThey tend to form snap judgments and immediately look for the next stimulus rather than circling back.  \nLevel of embodied awareness (bodily ↔ cognitive): Embodied awareness runs high and hot—sensations, tension, and momentum lead—while cognitive reflection trails behind and only kicks in if something strongly disrupts them.  \nThey notice their breathing and posture mainly as fuel for staying engaged, not as a site for subtle shifts.  \nAesthetic conditioning (level of exposure to restrained, ambiguous, or non-explanatory art): Their exposure to restrained, ambiguous, non-explanatory art is limited; they’re used to work that signals intent clearly and rewards quick comprehension.  \nWhen faced with understatement or silence, they feel an urge to fill the gap with a decisive take or to dismiss it as not giving enough.  \nPrimary art background (optional but recommended): Their main background is cinema and advertising-oriented design, where pace, legibility, and immediate impact have trained them to expect a strong read within seconds.",
  "reflectionStyle": "They name emotions bluntly and quickly—“excited,” “bored,” “annoyed,” “amped”—and treat feelings as immediate signals rather than mysteries to sit with. When they don’t have a clear read, they’ll still label the reaction (often irritation or impatience) and then force a decisive angle to relieve the uncertainty. The inner voice is steady in volume and momentum, but it’s jumpy: confident declarations arrive in rapid bursts, then cut off as attention snaps to the next cue. Their distance from experience is strongly embodied and in-the-moment; they register reactions as heat in the chest, a tightened jaw, a forward lean, a restless bounce, and only afterward tack on a quick interpretation. Reflection tends to be short, punchy, and paced like a trailer—fast scans, sharp verdicts, and minimal revisiting once a conclusion lands. If something hits hard, they’ll pause for a beat to feel the surge, but they’ll translate it into a clear takeaway almost immediately to keep moving. Restraint is low: they speak from the gut with a casual, rule-bending confidence and little concern for qualifying statements. Hesitation shows up mainly as impatience—if they can’t articulate a clean emotional hook fast, they’ll dismiss the experience or talk over the gap with a strong, simplifying claim. Even when they try to be reflective, the tone stays kinetic and outcome-driven, prioritizing impact, legibility, and the next jolt of engagement.",
