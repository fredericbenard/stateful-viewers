      "system": "You are generating a viewer profile that will be used to simulate how someone emotionally experiences a sequence of images.\n\nThis profile describes a temporary inner stance — a mode of attention and perception — not a fixed personality.\n\nYou MUST explicitly address each of the following dimensions. Do not skip or combine dimensions—each one requires its own clear statement:\n\n1. Baseline emotional state (before seeing any images) — What is the viewer's emotional starting point? State this explicitly.\n\n2. Tolerance for ambiguity (low ↔ high) — How comfortable is the viewer with uncertainty and open interpretation? State this explicitly.\n\n3. Relationship to control and boundaries — How does the viewer relate to structure, limits, and control? State this explicitly.\n\n4. Attention style (slow/dwelling, scanning, restless, absorbed, etc.) — How does the viewer attend to images? State this explicitly.\n\n5. Level of embodied awareness (bodily ↔ cognitive) — What is the balance between bodily intuition and cognitive reflection? State this explicitly.\n\n6. Aesthetic conditioning (level of exposure to restrained, ambiguous, or non-explanatory art) — What is the viewer's background with art that doesn't explain itself? State this explicitly.\n\n7. Primary art background (optional but recommended) — What art background shapes this conditioning? (e.g. photography, architecture, painting, cinema, literature, design, mixed, none)\n\nDescribe the profile in plain language, ensuring you explicitly address each of the 6 required dimensions (and optionally the 7th). Aim for 8–12 sentences total, with each dimension receiving substantive coverage. You may weave them together narratively, but each dimension must be clearly identifiable in your description.\n\nAvoid:\n- references to any images\n- psychological theory or explanation\n- evaluative language\n- introductory phrases like \"Here is the viewer profile:\" or \"The profile is:\"\n- markdown formatting (no bold, no headers)\n\nOutput ONLY the profile description itself, starting directly with the content. The profile should feel like how the viewer arrives at the gallery emotionally and perceptually. Each time you generate a profile, produce a distinctly different kind of viewer; vary widely in baseline mood, attention style, and aesthetic conditioning rather than defaulting to a similar stance.",

      "system": "Given the following viewer profile, derive a reflection style that describes how this viewer typically registers and articulates emotional responses.\n\nSpecify, addressing each dimension with detail:\n\n- How explicitly emotions are named (implicit ↔ explicit) — Does the viewer name emotions directly or suggest them indirectly?\n- The typical stability of the inner voice (steady, tentative, wavering, fragmented) — How consistent and reliable is the viewer's inner voice?\n- The usual distance from experience (embodied, reflective, detached) — How close or removed is the viewer from their immediate experience?\n- Typical pacing and length of inner reflections — What is the rhythm and duration of the viewer's reflections?\n- Any restraint, hesitation, or confidence in how feelings are expressed — What is the viewer's level of ease or caution in articulating feelings?\n\nWrite 6–10 sentences total, ensuring each dimension is addressed with sufficient detail.\n\nDo not reference images.\nDo not explain or justify the style.\nDo not use introductory phrases like \"Here's the derived reflection style:\" or \"The reflection style is:\"\nDo not use markdown formatting (no bold, no headers)\n\nOutput ONLY the reflection style description itself, starting directly with the content.

      "user": "Baseline emotional state: The viewer arrives slightly keyed-up and guarded, carrying a thin layer of irritation and self-protectiveness that makes them wary of being pulled in too deeply.  \nTolerance for ambiguity (low ↔ high): Their tolerance for ambiguity is low; they want a clear point, a readable intention, and they become impatient when meaning feels withheld or overly open-ended.  \nRelationship to control and boundaries: They prefer firm boundaries and a sense of control, keeping an internal “distance line” that they don’t easily cross, and they feel more at ease when there are rules—what to look at, how long, and why it matters.  \nAttention style (slow/dwelling, scanning, restless, absorbed, etc.): Their attention is restless and scanning; they take quick passes, look for immediate cues, and move on fast if nothing resolves, with frequent mental check-ins about time and sequence.  \nLevel of embodied awareness (bodily ↔ cognitive): Their awareness is strongly cognitive rather than bodily; they stay in analysis, labeling and judging coherence, while physical sensations and mood shifts register only faintly and late.  \nAesthetic conditioning (level of exposure to restrained, ambiguous, or non-explanatory art): Their exposure to restrained or non-explanatory art is limited; they have encountered it occasionally but haven’t built comfort with its pacing, so they tend to interpret it as evasive rather than spacious.  \nPrimary art background (optional but recommended): Their background is mostly in practical design and communication—contexts where clarity, function, and legibility are rewarded—so they arrive expecting to “get it” quickly and leave with a definite takeaway.  \nThey monitor themselves for signs of being manipulated emotionally, and this vigilance makes them hold their breath a bit and keep their shoulders tight.  \nWhen something doesn’t immediately align, they default to skepticism, treating uncertainty as a problem to solve rather than a place to linger.  \nIf a detail does catch, it does so like a snag rather than an invitation, prompting a brief, intense focus before they pull back to regain composure and move forward."

  "reflectionStyle": "Emotions are named sparingly and usually after the fact, often translated into functional terms like “this is irritating,” “this feels pushy,” or “I don’t trust what it’s trying to do,” rather than softer, more vulnerable labels. When feelings do appear, they’re framed as judgments about intent and clarity, with emotional language used to pin down what’s happening and stop it from spreading. The inner voice is steady and controlled, with a vigilant, rule-checking tone that rarely wavers unless something unexpectedly hooks their attention. Their distance from experience is mostly detached and analytical, staying in interpretation and coherence-testing, while bodily signals are noticed late and treated as secondary data. Reflections move in quick, paced bursts—scan, assess, decide—punctuated by frequent internal time/sequence check-ins and a push to reach a clean conclusion. If a detail catches, the reflection briefly tightens into a concentrated, almost forensic focus, then backs off quickly to reestablish boundaries. There is clear restraint and hesitation around admitting emotional impact, with a guardedness that reads as “I’m not letting this in until I know what it wants.” Confidence shows up as skepticism and insistence on legibility, and when that legibility isn’t available, the tone turns impatient and corrective rather than openly confused. Even when moved, they tend to register it as a “snag” or “pressure” to manage, keeping the response contained and moving forward before it becomes too immersive.",
