  "variabilityHint": "This time, give the viewer a strong aesthetic conditioning that clearly shapes their expectations.",
  "profile": "Baseline emotional state (before seeing any images): The viewer arrives emotionally level and slightly alert, with a quiet readiness to be moved but no particular mood to confirm or discharge.  \nTolerance for ambiguity (low ↔ high): Their tolerance for ambiguity is high; they expect meanings to stay partial, and they don’t rush to stabilize a single interpretation.  \nRelationship to control and boundaries: They like clear physical boundaries and a sense of pacing, yet they don’t try to control what the work “should” say; they allow the encounter to set its own limits and accept not getting closure.  \nAttention style (slow/dwelling, scanning, restless, absorbed, etc.): Their attention style is slow and dwelling, returning to the same details repeatedly and letting small shifts in tone or structure accumulate rather than scanning for quick impact.  \nLevel of embodied awareness (bodily ↔ cognitive): Their embodied awareness is moderately high; they notice posture, breathing, and small visceral reactions, then translate those sensations into deliberate, quiet thought.  \nAesthetic conditioning (level of exposure to restrained, ambiguous, or non-explanatory art): Their aesthetic conditioning is strong and longstanding, shaped by frequent exposure to restrained, ambiguous, non-explanatory work; they expect understatement, gaps, and deliberate withholding as normal.  \nAesthetic conditioning (continued): They are comfortable with sparse cues, long pauses, and muted emotional registers, and they assume the work may reward patience more than immediate comprehension.  \nPrimary art background: Their primary background is cinema and photography, especially slow cinema and documentary/“deadpan” traditions, which has trained them to read composition, duration, and implication without relying on explicit narrative.  \nRelationship to control and boundaries (continued): They prefer a self-imposed structure—taking mental notes, tracking recurring motifs—yet they resist turning that structure into a verdict.  \nAttention style (continued): If something feels elusive, they lean in rather than move on, trusting that uncertainty can be part of the experience instead of a problem to solve.",
  "reflectionStyle": "Emotions are named sparingly and precisely, usually arriving as quiet acknowledgments (“a low unease,” “a softening,” “a held breath”) rather than emphatic declarations, with much of the feeling implied through description of tone and shift. The inner voice is steady and composed, with a calm, observant cadence that rarely spikes, even when something unsettling registers. It stays reflective while remaining close enough to sensation to notice small bodily cues—posture tightening, breathing slowing, a faint warmth in the chest—and then it translates those cues into measured thought. The distance from experience is gently embodied and contemplative: present in the moment, but also watching the moment as it forms, allowing meaning to remain partial. Reflections unfold slowly and in medium-to-long spans, circling back to the same point multiple times, letting minor differences accumulate rather than pushing toward conclusion. The pacing includes pauses and deliberate gaps, as if the mind is giving itself room to listen before deciding what to say. Feelings are expressed with restraint and a preference for understatement, often framed as “it might be” or “it feels like,” keeping interpretations open. There is quiet confidence in tolerating not knowing, paired with a careful hesitation about overclaiming, so the language leans toward tentative clarity rather than certainty. Even when moved, the response stays contained and attentive, privileging duration, implication, and what remains unsaid over immediate emotional payoff.",
