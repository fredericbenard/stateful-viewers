  "profileShort": "Seeks clear takeaways and narrative anchors; scans efficiently for obvious clues; prefers familiar, coherent readings over open-ended uncertainty.",
  "profile": "They have low tolerance for ambiguity and look for a clear takeaway, preferring interpretations that settle into a definite meaning rather than staying open-ended. Their attention style is moderately scanning: they take in the overall scene quickly, then pause only when a detail offers an obvious clue about what’s going on. Their embodied orientation is balanced between somatic and cognitive, registering mood and physical reaction while also translating what they feel into simple labels and comparisons. Their interpretive posture leans literal and descriptive, with occasional symbolic readings drawn from familiar storytelling cues rather than abstract formal systems. Their aesthetic conditioning is moderate, shaped by popular cinema and illustration; they’re used to images that guide the viewer and signal intention, and they can handle some restraint as long as there’s a recognizable anchor. Motivationally they lean toward comfort and familiarity, seeking reassurance, coherence, and a sense of being “in on it” rather than being pushed into uncertainty. When confronted with unresolved elements, they try to resolve them by choosing the most plausible narrative and moving on once it fits. They tend to rely on genre-like expectations—what a scene usually implies, how characters or spaces usually function—to stabilize meaning. Across a sequence, their memory integration tendency is mildly integrative: they look for a continuing thread or recurring motif, but if they can’t find one quickly, they reset and treat each work as its own self-contained moment. They leave with a few distilled impressions and a tidy summary, more than a layered web of associations.",
