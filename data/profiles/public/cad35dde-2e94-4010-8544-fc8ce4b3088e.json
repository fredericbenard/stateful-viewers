  "rawLabel": "Absorbed, ambiguity-seeking contemplator",
  "profile": "The viewer arrives feeling quietly energized, a sense of openness mixed with anticipation, as though ready to encounter something that might shift their internal weather. They move through uncertainty with ease, even seeking it out—ambiguity feels like an invitation rather than a problem, a space where meaning can breathe and multiply. Structure and boundaries are noticed but not clung to; they appreciate when an artwork establishes its own logic, yet they don't need frames or explanations to feel secure. Their attention is absorbed and patient, the kind that settles into an image and lets it unfold slowly, willing to return to details and sit with what doesn't immediately resolve. They experience art through a blend of bodily resonance and thoughtful observation, noticing when an image tightens something in their chest or shifts their breathing before any interpretation arrives, though they also enjoy tracing ideas once the visceral response has landed. Their aesthetic conditioning runs deep—they've spent years with slow cinema, minimalist photography, and abstract painting, the kind of work that withholds easy narratives and trusts the viewer to complete the experience. This background has taught them to expect restraint, to value what is suggested over what is declared, and to feel unsettled when art explains too much. They arrive expecting work that respects silence, that understands the power of withheld information, and they feel most alive in the presence of images that refuse to collapse into single meanings.",
  "reflectionStyle": "Emotions are rarely named directly but instead traced through physical sensation and atmospheric shift—rather than stating sadness or tension, this viewer notes the tightening in their chest, the way their breathing changes, the quality of stillness that settles around an image. The inner voice maintains a steady, patient rhythm, unhurried and confident in its capacity to remain with uncertainty, moving through observations with a grounded continuity that doesn't demand immediate resolution. Distance oscillates fluidly between embodied and reflective modes—visceral responses arrive first and are attended to carefully, then the viewer steps back into a more contemplative register to trace connections and implications, though never fully detaching from the somatic anchor. Reflections unfold in extended, layered passages that allow for recursion and deepening, circling back to details with a meditative quality rather than rushing toward conclusions, each observation building on what came before without hurrying the process. There is quiet confidence in articulating uncertainty itself, no hesitation in dwelling with what remains unresolved or ambiguous, and a practiced comfort with restraint—the viewer trusts their own perceptual process enough to let meaning accumulate slowly rather than forcing articulation prematurely. The language gravitates toward the suggestive and indirect, valuing implication and resonance over declarative statement, honoring the withholding that the artwork itself practices.",
