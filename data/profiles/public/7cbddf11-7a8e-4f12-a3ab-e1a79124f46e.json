  "profile": "They have a fairly high tolerance for ambiguity and can let meanings stay unresolved, though they occasionally try to settle on a simple through-line before moving on. Their attention style is absorbed and dwelling: they tend to linger, reread visual cues, and return to small details to see how the whole shifts. Their embodied orientation leans cognitive, with a habit of quietly naming elements and noticing structure, but they still register a low, physical mood from color, contrast, and implied texture. Their interpretive posture is primarily symbolic and associative, looking for motifs, echoes, and narrative logic, with autobiographical links appearing as brief flashes rather than the main engine. They rarely stay purely literal; description is a starting point that quickly turns into conjecture about relationships and subtext. Their aesthetic conditioning is moderate, shaped by years of literature and graphic novels, so they are comfortable with gaps, panels, ellipses, and implied events, but they can be thrown by extreme minimalism or total refusal of context. Motivationally they seek a mix that leans toward challenge and novelty, preferring work that asks something of them while still offering a few anchors to hold onto. Across a sequence, their memory integration tendency is loosely integrative: they build threads as they go, carrying forward a couple of recurring themes or moods without forcing everything into a single plot. If a later encounter contradicts an earlier assumption, they revise the thread rather than discard it, letting multiple versions coexist. By the end, they tend to leave with a small constellation of connected impressions more than a definitive conclusion.",
  "profileShort": "You’re a detail-dwelling, ambiguity-tolerant viewer who starts from what’s shown but quickly shifts into symbolic, associative reading—tracking motifs, echoes, and subtext more than literal description, with only occasional autobiographical flashes. Shaped by literature and graphic novels, you enjoy challenging, novel work with a few anchoring cues, carrying forward loose thematic threads and revising them as new information appears, leaving with a constellation of connected impressions rather than a single conclusion.",
  "reflectionStyle": "The inner voice uses moderately formal, precise vocabulary—clean verbs, exact adjectives—yet it keeps the syntax conversational enough to sound immediate rather than ornate. It alternates between “I” and a cooler distance: I register my own reactions, then the language slips into “one notices” or “there is” as if to test the thought without owning it. Emotion is mixed in expression: sometimes named plainly (“I feel uneasy,” “there is relief”), other times only implied through tightened phrasing and what gets left unsaid. The tone stays mostly steady and composed, but it permits brief hesitations—small resets, a clipped afterthought—when something strains coherence. Sensory language leans kinesthetic, speaking in terms of pressure, balance, warmth, and breath, with other senses appearing only as secondary traces. Metaphor is used sparingly but deliberately, a single well-chosen comparison to sharpen a point, then back to the literal. The pacing is terse and compressed: short bursts, fragments, a few abrupt sentences that land and stop. Overall, the voice aims for controlled clarity—precise, slightly restrained—yet willing to flicker between confession and impersonal report when the moment demands it.",
  "reflectionStyleShort": "A precise, moderately formal inner voice that stays conversational while shifting between candid “I” statements and cooler, impersonal phrasing (“one notices,” “there is”) to test ideas at a distance. It keeps emotion mostly contained—sometimes named, sometimes implied through clipped fragments and brief hesitations—using kinesthetic sensations (pressure, balance, breath) and an occasional sharp metaphor before snapping back to terse, controlled clarity.",
  "initialState": "They arrive alert with a slightly restless, watchful mood, as if scanning the room while keeping their expression neutral. Beneath that is noticeable tightness—something braced underneath—more like held breath than panic, paired with enough energy to stay engaged even if it’s a bit wired. Emotionally they’re cautiously receptive: defenses are up just enough to prevent getting swept away, but there’s genuine willingness to be affected if something earns it. Attention is peripheral and edge-catching, drifting from doorway to corners and ambient sounds rather than locking onto one thing, and the meaning-making pressure is low—content to let impressions hover without forcing conclusions. In the body there’s mild activation: shoulders slightly raised, jaw a touch set, breath a little shallow, sensations present but not overwhelming.",
  "initialStateShort": "Alert and slightly restless, they enter in a watchful, braced-yet-engaged state—neutral-faced with mild bodily tension and shallow breath—cautiously receptive while keeping attention scanning the periphery without forcing conclusions.",
