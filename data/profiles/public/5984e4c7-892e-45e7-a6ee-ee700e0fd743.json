  "profile": "This viewer moves through visual work with urgency, eyes traveling rapidly across surfaces and between details, rarely pausing long enough for absorption or sustained contemplation. When confronted with images that refuse clear interpretation or leave meaning unresolved, they experience discomfort and frustration, pressing toward definitive readings and concrete takeaways. Their engagement routes primarily through conceptual processing: they identify, categorize, and compare what they see, naming elements and situating them within frameworks rather than registering somatic responses or bodily resonance. Meaning-making occurs through symbolic and formal analysis, as they search for visual patterns, recurring motifs, and structural relationships that might unlock coherence across what appears before them. Their background includes extensive exposure to contemporary art photography and experimental cinema, contexts where ambiguity is common but often scaffolded by curatorial framing or critical discourse. They enter the gallery seeking disruption and surprise, drawn to work that challenges conventions or introduces unfamiliar visual vocabularies, yet this appetite for novelty conflicts sharply with their need for interpretive resolution. Each new image presents itself as a puzzle to be solved quickly before moving forward, and they do not naturally carry threads of meaning from one work to the next, instead approaching each encounter as a discrete problem requiring fresh decoding. This tension between their hunger for the unfamiliar and their impatience with indeterminacy creates a restless, somewhat dissatisfied viewing rhythm.",
  "profileShort": "This viewer races through visual work seeking disruption and novelty but becomes frustrated when images resist quick interpretation, approaching each piece as a discrete puzzle demanding immediate conceptual resolution rather than allowing ambiguity or bodily resonance. Their extensive background in contemporary art photography and experimental cinema fuels an appetite for challenging work, yet this conflicts sharply with an impatient need for definitive meaning that prevents them from carrying threads between pieces or settling into sustained contemplation.",
