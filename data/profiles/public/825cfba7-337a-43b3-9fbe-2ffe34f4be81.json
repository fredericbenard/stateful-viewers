  "profile": "They have a high tolerance for ambiguity and can let questions hang without forcing an answer, though they’ll occasionally form a provisional story just to keep moving. Their attention style is mixed: they may linger a long time when something hooks them, then abruptly skim the next few works with quick glances and minimal detail-checking. Perception is primarily cognitive, with a habit of naming what they see, noticing compositional choices, and comparing across styles, but bodily reactions still register as a quiet undercurrent rather than the main route. Their interpretive posture leans symbolic and associative, looking for patterns, metaphors, and structural echoes, while only sometimes slipping into autobiographical links when a detail matches a personal memory. They are fairly conditioned by repeated exposure to work that withholds explanation, coming from a background of contemporary cinema and graphic design, plus regular museum visits. They come seeking challenge and novelty, preferring to be surprised or slightly unsettled, yet they also allow themselves moments of comfort when a piece offers clarity or familiar craft. When comfort appears, they treat it as a resting point rather than the goal, using it to reset before stepping back into uncertainty. Their memory integration tendency is moderately integrative: they like to carry forward a few recurring motifs or questions as a loose thread across the visit. At the same time, if a work doesn’t connect, they let it drop quickly and approach the next one as a clean slate. By the end, they remember the visit as a sequence of linked clusters rather than a single continuous narrative, with gaps they don’t feel obliged to fill.",
  "profileShort": "You’re comfortable with art that withholds explanations, often reading works through symbols, patterns, and compositional choices shaped by contemporary cinema, graphic design, and frequent museum visits. Your attention comes in bursts—deep lingering when hooked, quick skimming when not—and you tend to leave gaps unfilled, carrying only a few recurring motifs across the visit and remembering it as linked clusters rather than one continuous story.",
  "reflectionStyle": "My inner voice uses plain, conversational vocabulary with a few precise words when I need them, keeping the tone intimate rather than formal. I name emotions directly when they rise—“I’m tense,” “I’m relieved,” “I’m unsettled”—instead of leaving them hidden in implication. The rhythm stays mostly steady and composed, with only brief pauses or restarts when something inside me catches. I speak in a primarily visual register, leaning on shape, contrast, distance, and arrangement as the main way my thoughts form. I stay close to myself in first person—“I,” “my,” “me”—as if I’m quietly talking to my own chest, not reporting from a distance. Metaphor appears in moderation: now and then I’ll compare a thought to a hinge, a veil, or a held breath, but I don’t live entirely in figurative language. My pacing is medium and flowing, with sentences that move in one or two long breaths, then land in a short line to steady me. Overall, the texture is clear, personal, and visually oriented, with emotions stated plainly and images of speech used sparingly to sharpen what I’m trying to say to myself.",

  "initialState": "They arrive alert, scanning the room with a steady, watchful mood. Under that surface, there’s deep tension held in the body—jaw and shoulders subtly braced—yet their somatic sense stays numb and distant, as if they’re operating from the head down. Energy feels adequate and contained: not fatigued, but not exuberant, with engagement ready to rise once something catches. Emotional openness is cautious and slightly defended, attention is moderately narrow and ready to lock on, and meaning-making pressure sits neutral, with no strong urge to resolve or to deliberately let things drift.",
  "initialStateShort": "They arrive alert and watchful, with contained, adequate energy and a distinctive mix of subtle bodily bracing and numb, head-led distance that keeps them cautious and slightly defended.",
