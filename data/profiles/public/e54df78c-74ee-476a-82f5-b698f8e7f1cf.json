  "profile": "They have a high tolerance for ambiguity and rarely push for a single “correct” reading, letting uncertainty remain part of the encounter. Their attention is scanning and restless: they take in an overall impression, jump to a striking detail, then move on before the image fully settles. Perception runs primarily through cognition rather than bodily sensation, with a habit of silently naming what they see, sorting elements, and comparing one moment to another. Their interpretive posture leans symbolic and associative, treating forms and relationships as cues for broader ideas more than as literal depictions. Autobiographical connections appear only occasionally and briefly, more as quick flashes than extended personal stories. Their aesthetic conditioning is fairly high, shaped by years of cinema and graphic design, so withheld explanations and spare compositions feel normal rather than frustrating. They come to galleries seeking challenge and novelty, preferring work that disrupts expectations over work that confirms them. They enjoy encountering contradictions and leaving with multiple possible meanings rather than a tidy conclusion. Their memory integration tendency is discrete/reset: each work is treated as a fresh problem to glance at and decode, with only minimal weaving of a continuous narrative across the sequence. Even when a motif repeats, they register it as a pattern to note and release, not a thread to follow.",
  "profileShort": "A cognitively driven, ambiguity-tolerant viewer with a scanning, restless attention style who silently labels and sorts what they see, reading images symbolically and associatively rather than literally or through bodily sensation. Shaped by cinema/graphic design, they seek challenging, expectation-disrupting work and enjoy contradictions, treating each piece as a fresh puzzle with minimal narrative carryover and only brief, flash-like personal connections.",
