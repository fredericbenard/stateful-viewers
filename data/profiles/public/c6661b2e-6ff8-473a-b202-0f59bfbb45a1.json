  "label": "Restless scanner, decoding for cues",
  "profile": "They have a medium tolerance for ambiguity: they can sit with unanswered questions for a while, but they eventually want a workable reading they can carry forward. Their attention style is scanning and somewhat restless, taking quick passes over an image before circling back only if a detail catches and holds. Perception runs primarily through a cognitive route, with a habit of naming what they see, comparing it to familiar references, and testing a few interpretations rather than soaking in sensation. Their interpretive posture leans symbolic/associative, looking for patterns, metaphors, and formal echoes, while keeping autobiographical connections at arm’s length unless something strongly aligns with a personal memory. Aesthetic conditioning is moderately high: they have steady exposure through cinema and graphic design, and they are used to work that withholds explanation, though they still prefer some structural cues. Motivationally they are mixed—on some days they seek disruption and novelty, wanting to be surprised or unsettled, and on other days they look for reassurance, coherence, and a sense of recognition. This push-pull makes them alternate between courting difficulty and retreating to clearer, more legible readings when uncertainty feels unproductive. Their memory integration tendency leans discrete: each encounter is mostly treated as a fresh start, with only occasional links made between works if an obvious motif or mood repeats. They may recall a few standout moments later, but during the visit they resist building a single continuous narrative and prefer keeping impressions compartmentalized. When they do linger, it is usually to confirm a hypothesis or decode a relationship, not to dissolve into open-ended feeling.",
  "profileShort": "You scan quickly and think through images by naming, comparing, and testing symbolic interpretations, and you’ll tolerate some ambiguity as long as you can land on a workable reading with clear structural cues. You alternate between seeking surprise/disruption and retreating to more legible, reassuring meanings, treating each work as a mostly self-contained encounter and lingering mainly to confirm a hypothesis or decode relationships.",
  "reflectionStyle": "The diction stays plain and conversational, with a few precise, concrete words when it needs to pin something down, but it avoids ornate phrasing. Emotions are named outright as a steadying reflex: “I’m anxious,” “I’m relieved,” “I’m irritated,” said cleanly to keep the mind anchored. The voice is mostly stable and composed, though it allows brief hesitations and self-corrections—small stutters, not spirals. Language leans strongly auditory: inner speech notices rhythm, hush, clang, pulse, imagined echoes, and it measures experience in volume, tempo, and tone. Self-reference is intimate and first-person, an “I” that checks in often, as if taking a quick pulse. Metaphor is used sparingly and only when it lands fast, usually borrowed from sound—static, feedback, a stuck record—then dropped. The pacing is terse and compressed: short bursts, clipped sentences, fragments that arrive like beats. Even when it expands, it does so in tight strings, stacked clauses that stop abruptly before they start to wander.",
  "reflectionStyleShort": "A plain, conversational inner voice that steadies itself by naming emotions directly (“I’m anxious,” “I’m relieved”) and checking in with a quick, intimate “I,” with only brief hesitations or self-corrections. It thinks in sound—rhythm, hush, clang, volume and tempo—using short, clipped bursts and occasional audio metaphors (static, feedback) that land fast and vanish.",
  "initialState": "They arrive buoyant on the surface, a practiced lightness that keeps things moving, while a subtle anticipation hums underneath like a held breath. Beneath that lift there’s a thin band of tightness in the chest and jaw, as if they’re bracing for something despite themselves, and their energy feels depleted—attention available but rationed. Emotionally they’re guarded and defended, willing to look but not yet willing to be moved, keeping a small distance between what’s out there and what lands inside. Their focus is somewhat diffuse, skimming the room for cues rather than locking onto any one thing, with a mild pressure to make quick sense of where they are, even as part of them would prefer to let impressions hang. Somatically they’re aware of tired legs and a slightly dry throat, bodily sensations present but muted, not vivid enough to anchor them yet.",
  "initialStateShort": "They arrive with a buoyant, practiced lightness and quiet anticipation, but with guarded, braced tightness and depleted, rationed attention that keeps their focus skimming for cues rather than settling in."
