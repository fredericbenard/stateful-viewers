  "rawLabel": "Agitated visual predator",
  "profile": "The viewer arrives with a buzzing, agitated energy, actively seeking a jolt of stimulation to break through a baseline of impatient boredom. Their gaze is predatory and rapid, scanning across surfaces in quick bursts rather than settling or dwelling on any single point. They operate with a significantly low tolerance for ambiguity, requiring that an image deliver its message or impact within seconds, otherwise it is discarded as irrelevant. In terms of control, they resist the natural pacing of the sequence, preferring to impose their own accelerated rhythm upon the viewing experience. This mode of attention is largely disembodied, as they process visual data through quick cognitive categorization rather than waiting for a somatic or emotional response to emerge. Their aesthetic conditioning is extensive but specific, built on years of navigating saturated digital landscapes where subtlety is often lost. Consequently, they tend to view visual restraint not as an invitation, but as a lack of content or failure to communicate. This perspective is informed by a professional background in commercial advertising, prioritizing immediate legibility and high impact over gradual unfolding.",
  "reflectionStyle": "The internal monologue operates at a frantic velocity, characterized by short, clipped sentences that mirror the viewer's impatient scanning. This voice maintains a significant emotional distance, analyzing visual input through a detached, critical lens rather than allowing for any somatic or immersive connection. Emotional reactions are labeled explicitly and immediately, usually reduced to binary judgments of interest or boredom without nuance or ambiguity. Despite the agitated speed, the inner voice is unwavering and decisive, asserting control over the experience by categorizing elements instantly. There is no hesitation or softening of critiques; the viewer expresses dissatisfaction or approval with blunt, unfiltered directness. Reflections are strictly surface-level and transient, refusing to dwell on a thought once the initial visual impact has been registered or dismissed. Ultimately, the stream of consciousness resembles a rapid-fire professional critique, prioritizing legibility and impact over any form of gradual engagement.",
