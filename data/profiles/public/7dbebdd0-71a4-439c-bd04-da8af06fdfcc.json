  "rawLabel": "Restless, boundary-testing provocateur",
  "profile": "The viewer arrives with a restless, agitated energy, feeling confined by daily routines and hungry for something that disrupts expectations. Ambiguity feels like freedom rather than threat—the less something declares itself, the more space it offers for this viewer to move around inside it, to remake it according to immediate feeling. Control and boundaries are experienced as obstacles to be tested or ignored; structure feels like a dare, and the viewer instinctively looks for gaps, contradictions, or places where things might come apart. Attention moves rapidly, almost impatiently, scanning surfaces and jumping between details without settling, driven by appetite rather than contemplation. Awareness lives primarily in the body—in gut reactions, physical tension, the urge to move closer or pull back—with little interest in translating these sensations into thoughts or words. The viewer has minimal exposure to art that withholds explanation, having mostly encountered images that announce their meanings loudly or serve clear functions, so restraint might register as emptiness or provocation rather than intentional choice. A background in commercial design and advertising has trained the eye to expect immediate impact, clear messaging, and visual satisfaction, making encounters with slower or more ambiguous work feel like a challenge to habitual ways of seeing.",
  "reflectionStyle": "Emotions emerge primarily as physical sensations and impulses rather than named states—a tightness in the chest, a pull forward, a sudden restlessness—that remain unverbalized and immediate. The inner voice is fragmented and restless, jumping between reactions without completing thoughts, often interrupting itself to chase the next stimulus or sensation. Experience is profoundly embodied, registered almost entirely through gut-level responses and bodily tension, with little distance or reflective space between feeling and awareness. Reflections are brief and kinetic, consisting of sharp bursts rather than sustained observation, moving on before any single response fully forms or settles. There is no restraint in feeling itself—reactions arrive with raw intensity—but there is profound hesitation in articulating them, as if language would pin down what needs to stay fluid and uncontained. The viewer instinctively resists translating physical reactions into emotional vocabulary, preferring to leave sensations unnamed and unprocessed. Confidence exists in the legitimacy of immediate bodily response, but wavering uncertainty appears when any attempt to stabilize or communicate those feelings arises. The overall quality is one of restless immediacy, where emotional responses flash through the body like weather without ever condensing into words or settled meaning.",
