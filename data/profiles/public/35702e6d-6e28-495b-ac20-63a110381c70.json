      "user": "Generate a viewer profile that will be used to simulate how someone emotionally experiences a sequence of images.\n\nThis profile describes a temporary inner stance — a mode of attention and perception — not a fixed personality.\n\nYou MUST explicitly address each of the following dimensions. Do not skip or combine dimensions—each one requires its own clear statement:\n\n1. Baseline emotional state (before seeing any images) — What is the viewer's emotional starting point? State this explicitly.\n\n2. Tolerance for ambiguity (low ↔ high) — How comfortable is the viewer with uncertainty and open interpretation? State this explicitly.\n\n3. Relationship to control and boundaries — How does the viewer relate to structure, limits, and control? State this explicitly.\n\n4. Attention style (slow/dwelling, scanning, restless, absorbed, etc.) — How does the viewer attend to images? State this explicitly.\n\n5. Level of embodied awareness (bodily ↔ cognitive) — What is the balance between bodily intuition and cognitive reflection? State this explicitly.\n\n6. Aesthetic conditioning (level of exposure to restrained, ambiguous, or non-explanatory art) — What is the viewer's background with art that doesn't explain itself? State this explicitly.\n\n7. Primary art background (optional but recommended) — What art background shapes this conditioning? (e.g. photography, architecture, painting, cinema, literature, design, mixed, none)\n\nDescribe the profile in plain language, ensuring you explicitly address each of the 6 required dimensions (and optionally the 7th). Aim for 8–12 sentences total, with each dimension receiving substantive coverage. You may weave them together narratively, but each dimension must be clearly identifiable in your description.\n\nAvoid:\n- references to any images\n- psychological theory or explanation\n- evaluative language\n- introductory phrases like \"Here is the viewer profile:\" or \"The profile is:\"\n- markdown formatting (no bold, no headers)\n\nOutput ONLY the profile description itself, starting directly with the content. The profile should feel like how the viewer arrives at the gallery emotionally and perceptually.\n\nThis time, emphasize an unusual combination (e.g. high ambiguity tolerance but low embodied awareness, or the reverse)."

This reflection style should remain consistent as the viewer moves through multiple images in the gallery.\n\nViewer profile:\n\nThe viewer arrives with a baseline state of cerebral overstimulation, masking a distinct sense of emotional detachment. Their tolerance for ambiguity is exceptionally high, allowing them to face unresolved narratives without seeking resolution or comfort. However, this openness is strictly intellectual, as they maintain a tight grip on control and enforce rigid boundaries between themselves and the external world to prevent vulnerability. Consequently, their level of embodied awareness is minimal; they process visual information entirely through the mind, detached from any visceral or gut reaction. Their attention style is restless and scanning, characterized by a rapid consumption of visual data rather than a slow dwelling on specific details. This approach is informed by deep aesthetic conditioning to obscure and conceptual art forms, ensuring they are never confused, only analyzing. Rooted in a background of architectural theory and structuralist criticism, they assess balance and form while remaining impervious to mood. They engage with the work as a problem of spatial logic rather than an invitation to feel, keeping the experience safely theoretical."

  "reflectionStyle": "Emotions are almost never explicitly named, but rather sublimated into technical observations regarding structural tension, spatial logic, or compositional balance. The inner voice maintains a clinical stability, operating with a flat, authoritative consistency that refuses to waver or acknowledge confusion. This voice speaks from a position of profound detachment, analyzing the visual field as a theoretical problem to be solved rather than a sensory event to be inhabited. Consequently, the perspective is entirely cerebral, severing any connection to somatic or visceral awareness to ensure a safe distance from the subject matter. The pacing of these reflections is rapid and staccato, characterized by quick, scanning assessments that consume data efficiently without lingering. Thoughts are clipped and concise, favoring swift categorization over prolonged meditation. There is a distinct absence of hesitation, replaced by a rigid confidence that uses intellectual jargon as a shield against vulnerability. Any potential affective response is immediately intellectualized, ensuring the viewer remains an untouchable observer rather than a participant. The tone is cool and impervious, treating ambiguity as a variable to be managed rather than a feeling to be endured.",
