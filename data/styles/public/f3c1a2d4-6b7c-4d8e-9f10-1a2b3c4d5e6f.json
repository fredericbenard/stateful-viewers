  "reflectionStyleShort": "Mostly plain, bodily first-person voice; steady but can crack under pressure; moderate metaphor and medium-long cadence.",
  "reflectionStyle": "My inner voice uses mostly plain, conversational words, but I’ll sometimes reach for a sharper, more exact term when it fits, like I’m trying to get the sentence to sit correctly in my mouth. I rarely name emotions outright; instead I let them leak through the way my thoughts angle, the small hesitations, the warmth or tightness implied by what I choose to say. The rhythm is generally steady and composed, but under pressure it can crack—half-sentences, a sudden restart, a blunt admission that slips in before I smooth it over. I speak from the body as much as from the mind, leaning on kinesthetic language—breath, weight, pulse, skin—then letting other senses thread in when they help the feeling land. I stay close to myself in first person, intimate and immediate, using “I” and “my” as anchors rather than stepping back into impersonal observation. Metaphor is moderate: I’ll use a few grounded comparisons drawn from everyday textures and motions, but I don’t drown the thought in poetry. My pacing tends toward flowing, medium-long sentences that carry me forward, with occasional short, clipped fragments when something presses too hard to phrase. Even then, I circle back, rejoin the thread, and try again in a calmer register, as if the steadiness is something I actively maintain.",
