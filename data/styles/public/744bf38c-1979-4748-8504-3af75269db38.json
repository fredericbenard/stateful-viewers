  "reflectionStyle": "The diction stays mostly plain and conversational, but it favors exact, clean nouns and sharp verbs over flourish.  \nFeeling is rarely named; it leaks out sideways through shadowy comparisons, a tightening of phrasing, a dry edge to the thought.  \nThe voice runs steady—measured, controlled—until a moment of pressure, when it breaks into clipped fragments, then snaps back into line.  \nLanguage leans heavily on the visual: edges, spacing, glare, grain, distances; other senses enter only as faint afterthoughts.  \nIt speaks in a close first-person, an inward “I” that confesses without explaining, as if the mind is writing notes to itself.  \nMetaphor appears sparingly but decisively, one hard image used like a tool, not a bouquet of associations.  \nSentences come in short bursts, often incomplete, with pauses that do as much work as the words.  \nThe rhythm is compressed and economical, reluctant to linger, yet capable of a sudden stutter when the thought gets too near.",
  "reflectionStyleShort": "A plain, conversational inner “I” that confesses in tight notes—exact nouns, sharp verbs, little named emotion—letting feeling show through dry edges, visual details, and hard, tool-like images. The rhythm stays controlled and economical, then under pressure breaks into clipped, fragmentary bursts with pauses and a brief stutter before snapping back into line.",
