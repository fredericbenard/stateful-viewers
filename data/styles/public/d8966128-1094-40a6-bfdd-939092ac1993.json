  "label": "Lyrically hesitant",
  "reflectionStyle": "The inner diction leans literary and textured, favoring precise, slightly baroque words over plain talk, as if language were a velvet cloth tested between the fingers. Emotion is rarely named outright; it arrives obliquely, as pressure in the throat, as a tilt in the sentence, as an aftertaste that the mind circles without declaring. The voice is unstable by nature—now measured, now suddenly broken by an em dash, a parenthetical doubt, a quick reversal: no, not that; or rather, almost that. Sensation is carried primarily through kinesthetic and tactile phrasing, with a secondary drift into imagined sound, so thought moves by weight, pulse, friction, and faint internal echo more than by crisp depiction. Self-reference oscillates between intimate first-person and a cool, impersonal “one,” as if the speaker keeps stepping in and out of their own skin to check the fit. Metaphor is rich and opportunistic, turning abstraction into weather, fabric, architecture, or bruise-light, then discarding the figure when it starts to feel too certain. Pacing runs in long, flowing clauses that gather momentum, then snip themselves short—an abrupt, almost embarrassed silence—before starting again in a different key. Even certainty is spoken as provisional, a draft that revises itself mid-breath, so the inner voice feels like a handwritten page with crossings-out still visible.",
  "reflectionStyleShort": "A literary, tactile inner voice that thinks in velvet-friction and pulse rather than plain statement, letting emotion surface as an oblique throat-tightness or lingering aftertaste instead of being named. It constantly revises itself mid-breath—long clauses that abruptly cut off, em dashes and parenthetical doubts, shifting between “I” and “one,” spinning rich metaphors (weather/fabric/architecture) and dropping them the moment they start to harden into certainty.",
