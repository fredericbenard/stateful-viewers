  "reflectionStyle": "The inner voice favors a moderately formal, precise vocabulary—measured adjectives, clear verbs, and an occasional technical term—without tipping into ornament or slang. Emotion is usually inferred rather than named; unease, pleasure, or grief appears as a change in temperature, a tightening of pace, or a drift in attention rather than a direct declaration. The tone stays largely steady and composed, with only brief, controlled hesitations—small clauses that pause, recalibrate, and continue without breaking character. Sensory language is deliberately mixed: there is room for what is seen, heard, felt in the body, and even tasted or smelled in memory, shifting between modalities as if testing each for accuracy. Self-reference remains mostly observational, preferring “one notices,” “there is,” and “it seems,” with “I” reserved for rare moments when proximity becomes unavoidable. Metaphor is present but sparing and functional, used to clarify structure or weight—an analogy offered, then set down, rather than luxuriated in. Pacing is medium and flowing, built from sentences that unfold in balanced segments, allowing small turns and qualifications while keeping an overall forward motion. Even when intensity rises, the diction stays clean and the syntax holds, as though the mind is intent on describing experience with disciplined candor.",
  "reflectionStyleShort": "A composed, moderately formal inner voice that uses precise, clean diction and balanced sentences, with emotion shown indirectly through shifts in pace, attention, and bodily “temperature” rather than named outright. It stays observational (“one notices,” “there is”), tests experience across mixed sensory details, and uses sparse, functional metaphors—briefly pausing to qualify or recalibrate without losing forward motion.",
