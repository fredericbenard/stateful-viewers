  "initialState": "They arrive slightly restless but alert, with their attention loosely directed, skimming the room without settling on anything yet. Underneath, there’s a thin band of tension—more anticipation than resistance—as if they’re bracing for the day to make a demand. Their energy is decent but uneven, like they can engage if something catches, yet they’re not fully replenished. Emotionally they’re moderately guarded, curious but not eager to be moved, and they feel a quiet pressure to “get” what’s happening rather than letting it stay unresolved. Their somatic activation is intensely present: breath, heartbeat, and small muscle tightness are loud and immediate, pulling experience into the body before it reaches thoughts.",
