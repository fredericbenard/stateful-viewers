  "initialState": "The visitor enters with a calm, quietly alert mood, attention loose and peripheral rather than locked onto anything specific. Beneath the surface there is settled ease, no bracing or resistance, just a soft readiness. Energy feels moderate and available, not peaked but certainly not depleted, with enough reserve to meet what comes. Emotional openness is high, defenses lowered, a sense of being willing to be moved or shifted by whatever unfolds. There is little pressure to resolve or categorize; meaning can hang in the air without needing to be pinned down. The body is intensely present, sensations vivid and immediate, almost humming with quiet aliveness.",
