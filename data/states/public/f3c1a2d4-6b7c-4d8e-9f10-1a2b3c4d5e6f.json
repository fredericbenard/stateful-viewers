  "initialStateShort": "Alert, quietly buoyant; subtle anticipatory tightness; receptive but slightly held back; vivid somatic presence; low pressure to resolve meaning.",
  "initialState": "They arrive alert and quietly buoyant, with a hint of curiosity in the foreground. Underneath, there’s subtle anticipation—an almost pleasant tightness in the chest and shoulders—more poised than anxious. Energy feels moderate and steady, enough to engage without strain, and they’re emotionally receptive, willing to be moved even as they keep a small part of themselves held back. Attention is slightly diffuse at the threshold, taking in the space broadly before it narrows, and there’s little pressure to pin down meaning right away—more readiness to let things unfold. Somatically they’re intensely present: breath, heartbeat, and skin awareness are loud and immediate, making the moment feel vivid and close.",
